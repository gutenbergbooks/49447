on the Hindoo-Koosh&mdash;Evils of our Policy&mdash;Defective

<p><span class="beg">Restored</span> to the home of his fathers, Shah Soojah was
not contented. Even during the excitement of the march
to Caubul he had complained of the narrow kingdom to
which he was about to return; and now, as he looked out
from the windows of his palace over the fair expanse of
country beneath him, he sighed to think that the empire
of Ahmed Shah had been so grievously curtailed.</p>

<p>Very different, indeed, was the Douranee Empire, over
which the sceptre of Shah Soojah was now waved, from
that which his father had handed down to Zemaun Shah
and his brothers, to be sacrificed by their weakness and
disunion. The kingdom, which had once extended from
Balkh to Shikarpoor, and from Herat to Cashmere, had
now shrunk and collapsed. On every side its integrity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
had been invaded. Cashmere and Mooltan had fallen to
the Sikhs; Peshawur had been wrested from the Afghans
by the same unscrupulous neighbour; the independence
of Herat had been guaranteed to a branch of the Royal
family; the Beloochees had asserted pretensions unknown
in the times of Ahmed Shah; the petty Princes on the
northern hill-frontier no longer acknowledged their allegiance
to Caubul. In whatsoever direction he turned his
eyes, he beheld the mutilations to which the old Douranee
Empire had been subjected; and yearned to recover some
of the provinces which had been severed from the domain
of his fathers.</p>

<p>But the kingdom to which he had been restored was
more extensive than he could govern. There were many
difficult questions to be solved, at this time; the first and
the most important of which related to the continuance of his
connexion with his Feringhee allies. The British Government
had now done all that it had undertaken to do.
It had escorted Shah Soojah to his palace gates, and
seated him upon the throne of his fathers. In accordance
with Lord Auckland’s manifesto, the time had now
arrived for the withdrawal of the British army. But it
was obvious that the British army could not yet be withdrawn.
The Shah had no hold upon the affections of
his people. He might sit in the Balla Hissar, but he
could not govern the Afghans. Such, at least, was the
conviction which by this time had forced itself upon
Macnaghten’s mind. If the British Minister had ever
contemplated the early abandonment of the restored
King, the idea had now passed away. The Shah himself
felt no confidence in his own strength. He did not
believe that the power of Dost Mahomed was irretrievably
broken, but still saw him, in imagination, flitting about
the regions of the Hindoo-Koosh, raising the Oosbeg tribes,
and pouring down for the recovery of Caubul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>There were objections, many, and weighty, to the continued
occupation of Afghanistan by British troops&mdash;objections
of one kind, which the Shah acknowledged and
appreciated; and objections of another, which every
statesman and soldier in India must have recognised with
painful distinctness. But the experiment of leaving Shah
Soojah to himself was too dangerous to be lightly tried.
The Shah would fain have rid himself of British interference
and control, if he could have maintained himself
without British support; and the British Government
would fain have withdrawn its troops from Afghanistan,
if it could have relied upon the power of the Shah to
maintain himself. But to leave the restored Suddozye to
be dethroned and expelled, after the homeward march of
the troops that had restored him, would have been to
court an enormous failure, which would have overwhelmed
our government with disgrace. Neither was the restoration
sufficiently popular in itself, nor was there sufficient
stability in the character of the King to warrant
so hazardous an experiment. If the policy of the Afghan
invasion had not been based upon error, the experiment
would not have been a hazardous one. But the very
acknowledgment of the Shah’s inability to maintain himself
after the departure of the British army, was a crushing
commentary on the assertions put forth in the great
October manifesto. The truth was not to be disguised.
The “adoration” which had greeted the Shah on his
return to his long-lost dominions, was found to be a delusion
and a sham. The palace of his fathers had received
him again; but it was necessary still to hedge in the
throne with a quickset of British bayonets.</p>

<p>So thought Lord Auckland. He had given his mind
long and painfully to the subject, and had written an
elaborate minute, reviewing all the circumstances of our
position in Afghanistan after the entry of the Shah into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the country. Macnaghten had been settled little more
than a month in Caubul when a copy of this minute,
dated Simlah, August 20, was put into his hands. There
was nothing unintelligible in it. Ably written, clearly
worded, it enunciated, in unmistakeable paragraphs, the
views of the Governor-General, and left Macnaghten, even
had he been disposed to follow an opposite course, which
he was not, no alternative but to retain a portion of the
troops, and himself to abide at Caubul as controller of
the Shah. Lord Auckland saw plainly the advantages
of withdrawing the Army of the Indus. India could ill
afford the abstraction of so large a body of disciplined
troops, and it was probable that their services might be
required in less remote regions; but he could not purchase
the advantages of their withdrawal at the price of
the failure of the Afghan expedition.</p>

<p>It was the opinion of the Governor-General at this
time, that although the British army could not with
safety be wholly withdrawn, a force consisting of some
five or six regiments of all arms would be sufficient to
keep Shah Soojah upon his throne. The Bombay troops
were to be withdrawn, <i>en masse</i>, by the Bolan Pass; and
a portion of the Bengal army by the route of Jellalabad
and the Khybur. The posts at which it was expedient to
plant the remaining troops were, in the opinion of the
Governor-General, the two chief cities of Caubul and
Candahar; and the principal posts on the main roads to
Hindostan&mdash;Ghuznee and Quettah, on the West, and
Jellalabad and Ali-Musjid on the East. The orders which
Sir John Keane had issued, before the Governor-General’s
minute had reached Caubul, anticipated with much exactness
the instructions of the Governor-General. A brigade
under Colonel Sale was to remain in Afghanistan. Sir
John Keane was to take the remainder of the Bengal
troops back to India by the Khybur route; and General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Willshire was to lead the Bombay column down by the
western line of the Kojuck and the Bolan.</p>

<p>Such were the intentions both of the Supreme Government
and the local authorities, when Prince Timour
arrived at Caubul, accompanied by Captain Wade, and
the little force that had made good his entry into Afghanistan
by the eastern passes. It was on the 3rd of September
that Cotton, Burnes, and other British officers,
with a guard of honour, went out to receive the Prince.
With befitting pomp, the procession made its way
through the narrow streets of Caubul to the Balla
Hissar; and there were those who said that the gaiety
of the heir-apparent and his <i>cortège</i> fairly shone down
the King’s.</p>

<p>Wade had done his duty well. The magnitude of the
operations to the westward has somewhat overlaid the
more modest pretensions of the march through the eastern
passes; and it may be doubted whether the merit of the
achievement has ever been fully acknowledged. Viewed as
the contribution of the Sikh Government towards the
conquest of Afghanistan, it is absolutely contemptible.
Runjeet lay dying when the troops were assembling; and
his death was announced before they commenced their
march. He was the only man in the Sikh empire who
was true at heart to his allies, and all genuine co-operation
died out with the fires of his funeral pile. To Wade
this was embarrassing in the extreme. But the greater
the inefficiency of the Sikh demonstration, the greater the
praise that is due to the English officer who triumphed
over the difficulties thrown in his way by the infidelity of
his allies.</p>

<p>Wade found himself at Peshawur with a motley assemblage
of Hindoos, Sikhs, and Afghans, on the good faith
of a considerable portion of whom it was impossible to
rely. The Prince himself was soon found to be an absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
cypher. His most remarkable characteristic was, to
speak paradoxically, that he had no character at all. He
was a harmless, respectable personage, with an amount of
apathy in his constitution which was sometimes advantageous
to those in whose hands he placed himself; but
which, at others, engendered an amount of impracticability
that was very embarrassing and distressing. It was plain
that, whatever was to be accomplished, must be accomplished
by the energy of the British officers. Left to
themselves, the Sikhs, aided by the Afghans who had
joined the standard of the Prince, would never have
forced the Khybur Pass. This formidable defile was supposed
to be, if vigorously defended, impassable; and the
long halt at Peshawur had given the Afreedis, if they
were not inclined to sell the passage, abundant time to
mature their defensive operations, and Akbar Khan, who
was coming down from Caubul to oppose the march of
Wade and the Sikh auxiliaries, every opportunity of perfecting
his plans.</p>

<p>It was not until the 25th of July that Wade and
Prince Timour found themselves before Ali-Musjid. The
Afreedis, on that and the preceding day, had made some
show of resistance; and our troops&mdash;the regulars under
Captain Farmer, and the irregulars under Lieutenant
Mackeson,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;had done good service; whilst Colonel Sheikh
Bassawan, with the Sikh auxiliaries, had exhibited an
amount of zeal which had won the confidence of the
British officers. So closely now did Wade invest the
place, so determined was the attitude he had assumed,
and so successful was the play of his guns,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
night of the 26th the garrison evacuated the fortress;
and on the following morning the allies took possession
of Ali-Musjid in the name of the Shah. The Ameer’s
son had not come down to its defence.</p>

<p>There was little more work for Wade and his auxiliaries.
Akbar Khan, who had pitched his camp at Dakha&mdash;a
place to the south of Jellalabad&mdash;had now broken it up
and retired to join his father, who had by this time discovered
that the greater danger was to be apprehended
from the western line of attack, and had therefore recalled
his son to the capital. The Shah-zadah and his party,
therefore, advanced without further opposition. Opposite
Dakha, on the other side of the Caubul river, was the fort
of Lalpoorah, where dwelt Sadut Khan, chief of the
Momund tribe. His conduct had evinced strong feelings
of hostility to the Suddozye Princes. He was now, therefore,
to be reduced, and his chiefship conferred on another.
Throughout our entire connexion with Afghanistan, it
was seldom our good fortune to select fitting objects
whereon to lavish our bounty. It was generally, indeed,
our lot to set up the wrong man. But the case of Tora-baz
Khan, who was appointed to the chiefship of Lalpoorah,
was one of the few fortunate exceptions to this calamitous
rule. In this man we found a faithful ally; and when
misfortunes overtook us, he was not unmindful of the
benefits he had received at our hands.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of September, Wade and the Shah-zadah
reached Caubul. The operations of the motley force
which they had led through the difficult passes of Eastern
Afghanistan have been dwarfed, as I have said, by the
more ostentatious exploits of Sir John Keane’s bulkier
army; but it is not to be forgotten, that it was in no small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
measure owing to the operations of Wade’s force that the
resistance offered to Keane’s army was so slight and so ill-matured.
It was long before Dost Mahomed ceased to
regard the movement through the Khybur with greater
anxiety than that of the main army along the western
route. Akbar Khan and his fighting men never met
Wade in the field; but they were drawn away from the
capital at a time when they might have done good
service in the West; and it is in no small measure owing
to this division of the Ameer’s military strength, that he
was unable to offer any effectual resistance to the march
of the British army from Candahar. Nor, when we take
account of the circumstances which facilitated our success
at the outset of the war, ought it ever to be overlooked
that Wade, from his forward position at Peshawur,
was enabled to open a correspondence with parties
at Caubul favourable to the restoration of the monarchy,
and to win over many adherents to the Shah before he
approached his capital. It was in no small measure
owing to Wade’s diplomacy, carried on mainly through
the agency of Gholam Khan, Populzye, that the Kohistanees
were induced to rise against the Ameer.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> These
were important services. Wade carried on the work with
much address; and there were able men associated with
him.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But the whole affair was a melancholy illustration
of the lukewarmness, if not of the positive infidelity, of our
Sikh allies. It was plain that, thenceforth, we were to
expect little from their alliance, but ill-concealed attempts
to thwart and baffle the policy to which they were parties.</p>

<p>The month of September passed pleasantly over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
heads of the officers of the Army of the Indus. The fine
climate, the fair scenery, and the delicious fruits of Caubul,
were all things to be enjoyed, after the sufferings and
privations of the long and toilsome march from Hindostan.
Then there were shows, and spectacles, and amusements.
The troops were reviewed; and the officers rode races;
and the Shah, ever delighting in pageantry and parade,
established an order of knighthood, and held a grand
Durbar, at which the ceremony of investure was performed
with becoming dignity and grace. And the officers, happy
in the belief that they were soon about to turn their
backs on Afghanistan for ever, went about purchasing
memorials of their visit to Caubul, or presents to carry
back to their friends.</p>

<p>But the hopes of many were doomed to disappointment.
On the 18th of September, the Bombay column commenced
its march to India, by the route of the Kojuck and the
Bolan; and it was believed that a large portion of the
Bengal troops would soon be in motion towards the provinces,
along the eastern country just traversed by Colonel
Wade. A country in which wine was selling at the price
of 300 rupees a dozen, and cigars at a rupee a piece,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> was
not one in which the officers of the army were likely to
desire to pitch their tents for a sojourn of any long continuance.
When, therefore, it began to be reported among
them that the original intentions of withdrawing the
troops, with the exception of a single brigade, had been
abandoned, there was a general feeling of disappointment.
The official order was looked for with anxiety; and on the
2nd of October it appeared.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The principal portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the division was to be left in Afghanistan, under Sir
Willoughby Cotton; and only a comparatively small
detachment was to march to the provinces with Sir John
Keane. A week afterwards, orders were issued for the
disposition of the troops, and the military occupation of
Afghanistan was complete.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>A change so great as this in the military arrangements,
consequent on the restoration of Shah Soojah, could only
have been brought about by a belief in the presence of
some new and pressing danger. Dost Mahomed had been
driven across the Hindoo-Koosh; but it was believed that
he might there be hospitably received by some of the
petty Oosbeg chiefs, between Bameean and Balkh; and
that he might, united with them, gather sufficient strength
to encourage him to turn his face again towards the South,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and to sweep down upon the country which had been
wrested from him. It had not, at first, been conceived
that the prospect of the Ameer’s recovery from the heavy
blow which had descended upon him, was sufficiently
imminent to indicate the necessity of making any preparations
upon a large scale to arrest his return to
Afghanistan. But it was considered expedient to send a
detachment of the Shah’s troops, with some field artillery,
to Bameean, the extreme frontier station of the Shah’s
dominions. Accordingly, on the 12th of September, a
detachment had marched for the Hindoo-Koosh. A troop
of Native Horse Artillery, which had just come in from
Candahar, formed the most remarkable portion of this
little force. The difficulties of the road to be traversed
were such as no European artillery had ever before encountered.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
But, in spite of this, the 4th troop, 3rd
Brigade of Horse Artillery, under Lieutenant Murray
Mackenzie (leaving its captain dead at Caubul), made good
its way to Bameean; and the Shah’s Goorkha regiment,
with other irregular details, accompanied it to its dreary
winter-quarters in the mountainous recesses of the great
Caucasian range.</p>

<p>Upon the policy of this movement I cannot pause to
speculate. I believe that the system of planting small
detachments in isolated positions was one of the great
errors which marked our military occupation of Afghanistan.
But something more was designed than this. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
was in contemplation to send a larger force to explore the
mountains of the Hindoo-Koosh. Dr. Percival Lord, who
had been one of Burnes’s companions on the “Commercial
Mission” to Caubul, had just returned to the Afghan
capital with the force under Colonel Wade; and now that
it was considered desirable to despatch a political officer
to the Oosbeg frontier, it was but natural that Lord, who
had visited the neighbourhood of Koondooz in 1837-1838,
should have been selected for the duty. Lord went; but
had not been long absent from Caubul when he returned,
with exaggerated stories of the success of Dost Mahomed
among the petty chiefs of the Hindoo-Koosh, and of a
great movement which was about to be made for the re-establishment
of the supremacy of the Ameer. Upon
this, Macnaghten, who had begun to doubt the extreme
popularity of Shah Soojah, and the safety of confiding his
protection and support to the handful of British troops
which it was originally intended to leave in Afghanistan,
made a requisition to Sir John Keane for a stronger military
force, and turned Dr. Lord’s story to account in the
furtherance of his own views.</p>

<p>It was easy to issue orders for the maintenance of a
large body of British troops in Afghanistan; but it was
not so easy to house the regiments thus maintained. The
winter was before them. They could not remain encamped
on the plain around Caubul. It became, therefore, matter
of anxious consideration how accommodation was to be
provided for so large a body of regular troops. The
subject, indeed, had pressed upon the attention of the
political and military chiefs before the brigade, which was
originally to have been left in the country, had swelled
into a division; and the engineer officers had been called
into council, and had given the only advice that was likely
to emanate from competent military authority. Lieutenant
Durand&mdash;a gallant soldier and an able scientific officer&mdash;saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
at once the importance of posting the troops in the
Balla Hissar.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And there, in the winter of that year, they
were posted, to be removed in the following autumn to
the fatal cantonments which by that time were springing
up on the plain.</p>

<p>The city of Caubul is situated between two ranges of
lofty hills, along the ridges of which run lines of loop-holed
walls, with here and there small obtruding towers,
or bastions, too weak and too extended to be serviceable
for purposes of defence. It is said to be about three miles
in circumference. The Balla Hissar stands on a hill, overlooking
the city. There are, strictly speaking, two Balla
Hissars; the lower of which, on our first entry into
Caubul, was in a rickety and decayed state, and could not
have stood for an hour against British artillery. Both
were commanded by the walled hills above them. The
upper Balla Hissar, or citadel, commands the whole of the
city and the suburbs. The lower Balla Hissar, which is
surrounded by a shallow but rather deep ditch, commands
only part of one of the bazaars&mdash;the Shore bazaar&mdash;two
large forts (Mahmoud Khan’s and the Beenee Hissar),
and the road to Jellalabad. The houses of the town are
mostly flat-roofed; the streets for the most part narrow
and tortuous. The most important feature of it is the
great bazaar, built, or commenced, by Ali Murdan Khan&mdash;a
mart for the produce of all the nations of the East.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bombay division of the Army of the Indus marched
from Caubul on the 18th of September; and on the 15th
of October, Sir John Keane, with the troops destined for
Bengal, set out for the provinces by way of the eastern
passes. The Shah had by this time begun to think of
escaping from the severity of the Caubul winter, and
reposing in the milder climate and more tranquil neighbourhood
of Jellalabad. The sweets of restored dominion
had not gratified him to the extent of his anticipations.
He was, indeed, a disappointed man. He sighed as he
declared that the Caubul he had revisited was not the
Caubul of his youth; his kingdom seemed to have shrivelled
and collapsed; and even of these shrunken dominions,
fettered and controlled as he was, he was only half a king.
It was plain that, in the eyes of his subjects, his connexion
with the Feringhees had greatly humiliated him. But he
wanted the English money and the English bayonets, and
was compelled to bear the burden.</p>

<p>Macnaghten was to accompany the King to Jellalabad;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and, in the meanwhile, Burnes was to be left in political
charge of Caubul and the neighbourhood. The people
seemed to be settling down into something like quiescence.
If there were little enthusiasm among them, they seemed
at first to be outwardly contented with the change.
Cupidity is one of the strongest feelings that finds
entrance into the Afghan breast. The boundless wealth
of the English had been a tradition in Afghanistan ever
since the golden days of Mountstuart Elphinstone’s mission.
Money had been freely scattered about at Candahar; and
it was believed that with an equally profuse hand it would
now be disbursed at Caubul. It is true that the military
chest and the political treasury had been so indented
upon, that when the army reached the capital there was
a painful scarcity of coin.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> But there were large supplies
of treasure on the way. The jingling of the money-bag
was already ravishing their ears and stirring their hearts.
They did not love the Feringhees; but they delighted in
Feringhee gold.</p>

<p>This was a miserable state of things; and even the
influence of the gold was limited and short-lived. After
the outbreak at Caubul, when Mohun Lal was secreted
in the Kuzzilbash quarters, he heard the men and
women talking among themselves, and saying that the
English had enriched the grain-sellers, the grass-sellers,
and others who dealt in provisions for man and beast,
whilst they reduced the chiefs to poverty, and killed the
poor by starvation. The presence of the English soon
raised the price of all the necessaries of life. This was
no new thing. If a flight of Englishmen settle in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
French or a Belgian town, it is not long before the
price of provisions is raised. But here was a Commissariat
department, with a mighty treasury at its command,
buying up all the commodities of Caubul, and
not only paying preposterous sums for everything they
purchased, but holding out the strongest inducement to
purveyors to keep back their supplies, in order to force a
higher range of prices.</p>

<p>Even from this early date everything was working
silently against us. The inherent vice of the course of
policy which we had initiated was beginning to infect
every branch of the administration. The double government
which had been established was becoming a
curse to the whole nation. The Shah and his officers
ostensibly controlled all the departments of civil administration;
but everywhere our English officers were
at their elbow, to counsel and suggest; and when it
was found necessary to coerce the disobedient or punish
the rebellious, then it was British authority that drew
the sword out of the scabbard, and hunted down offenders
to the death. Bound by treaty not to interfere in
the internal administration of the country, the British
functionaries were compelled to permit the existence of
much which they themselves would never have initiated
or allowed in provinces subject to their rule; but they
were often called upon to enforce measures, unpopular
and perhaps unjust; and so brought down upon themselves
the opprobrium which was not always their due.
It could hardly be said that the King possessed a government
of his own, when the control of the army and the
exchequer was in the hands of others. England supplied the
money and the bayonets; and claimed the right to employ
them both according to her own pleasure. It would have
been a miracle if such a system had not soon broken down
with a desolating crash, and buried its authors in the ruins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>It was said prophetically by more than one statesman,
that our difficulties would begin where our military
successes ended. Englishmen and Afghans alike said
that it was easy to restore Shah Soojah to the throne,
but difficult to maintain him upon it. It was, from the
first, only a question of time&mdash;only a question how long
such a system could be propped up by the strong arm
and the long purse of the king-makers. No amount of
wisdom in the agents of such a policy could have saved
it from ultimate ruin. Sooner or later it must have
fallen. If there had been nothing else indeed to bring it
to the ground, the utter exhaustion of the Indian treasury
must have given it its death-blow.</p>

<p>To have placed Shah Soojah on the throne, and to
have left him again to be driven back an outcast and a
fugitive, to seek an asylum in the provinces of India,
would have been a failure and a disgrace. It was the
object of the British Government, therefore, to hedge
him in a little longer with our authority, and to establish
him more firmly on the throne. But so far from these
being synonymous terms, and co-existent states of being,
they were utterly antagonistic and irreconcileable. The
more we surrounded the King with our authority, the
less firmly he was fixed on the throne. It might have
been sound policy to have continued the occupation of
Afghanistan, if our continuance there had tended to secure
the supremacy of the Shah, and to establish him in the
affections of the people; but it was not in the nature of
things that the effect of the experiment should not have
been diametrically the reverse.</p>

<p>So prodigious an anomaly was the system itself, that,
except so far as it affected the period of its dissolution,
retarding or expediting it by a few months or a few
years, the agency employed in the vain attempt to uphold
it was a matter of little moment. But that agency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
was assuredly not of a character to enhance the chances
even of its temporary success. Shah Soojah had brought
from Loodhianah one Moollah Shikore<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&mdash;a man who
had shared his exile, and acted as his confidential agent.
He was old, and enfeebled by age. His memory was
gone; so were his ears. For some offence against his
Majesty in former days, he had forfeited those useful
appendages. A happy faculty of remembering the persons
and personal histories of men, is one of the most
useful ingredients in the character of a statesman, and it
is one which, in rare exuberance, some of our greatest
statesmen have possessed. But it was said of this Moollah
Shikore, that men whom he had seen on one day he
forgot on the next.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The King had abundant faith in
his loyalty, and confidence in his personal attachment.
The man had managed the stunted household of the
royal exile with such address, that it was believed that
he could now manage the affairs of his master’s restored
dominions. So he was made minister of state.
They called him Wuzeer. But his master did not
acknowledge the title, and the British did not call
him by it. “Bad ministers,” wrote Burnes, “are in
every government solid grounds for unpopularity; and I
doubt if ever a King had a worse set than Shah Soojah.”
The system itself was rotten to the very core; and the
agency employed was, perhaps, the corruptest in the
world. Had there been much more vitality and strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
in the system, Moollah Shikore and his deputies would
soon have given it its death-blow.</p>

<p>But though feeble in other respects, this Moollah
Shikore was not feeble in his hatred of the British. The
minister oppressed the people. The people appealed
to the British functionaries. The British functionaries
remonstrated with the minister. And the minister
punished the people for appealing.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The Shah and the
Moollah chafed under the interference of the British. But
they loved the British money; and they required the support
of the British bayonets. And so bravely for a time
worked the double government at Caubul.</p>

<p>Whilst such was the state of things at the supreme
seat of government, there was little less to create dissatisfaction
in the internal administration of Candahar.
The principal revenue officers were two Sheeahs, the
sons of that Hussein Khan, the obnoxious minister whom
Shah Zemaun had put to death. Their names were
Mahomed Takee Khan and Wulloo Mahomed Khan.
Cradled in intense enmity to the Douranees, they had
grown into unscrupulous persecutors of the tribes. Selected
by the Barukzye Sirdars as willing agents of
those humiliating and enfeebling measures by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
they sought to extinguish the vitality of the Douranees,
they entered upon their work in a ruthless and uncompromising
spirit, and plied the instruments of their office
with remarkable success for the persecution and degradation
of their enemies. The hatred with which the
Douranees regarded these men was too deep to suffer
them to embrace with complacency any measures, however
conciliatory in themselves, of which the old Barukzye
tools were the executors. Such unpopular agents
were enough to render distasteful the most popular
measures. The Douranees were, indeed, greatly disappointed.
Do what they would, they could not obtain a
paramount influence in the state. The door was closed
against them by the British janitors who kept watch
around the palace; and the chiefs soon began to chafe
under the foreign intrusion which deprived them of all
ascendancy in the councils of the restored monarch, and
prevented them from regaining the full extent of those
financial privileges which they had enjoyed under his
Suddozye predecessors.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>And so it happened that, from the very dawn of the
Restoration, unpopular and unscrupulous Afghan agents
were employed to carry out a monstrous system. Of a
very different character were the British agents upon
whom now devolved the duty of watching the proceedings
of the native executive, and, without any palpable acknowledged
interference, virtually controlling it. The political
agents scattered about Afghanistan have drawn down
upon themselves a larger measure of vituperation than
perhaps has ever descended upon any body of British
functionaries. They were mixed up with an unholy and
a disastrous policy, and perhaps some little of the evil
that subsequently developed itself may be attributed to
their personal defects; but, on the whole, they were not
unwisely chosen, and it is doubtful if other men would
have done better. At all events, when Burnes, Conolly,
Leech, Pottinger, Todd, Lord, and others, who had previously
made themselves acquainted with the country and
the people, were sent to overlook the progress of affairs in
different parts of Afghanistan, it cannot be said that no
care was taken to select our agents from among the
officers who were most qualified by previous experience to
perform the new duties devolving upon them. Macnaghten’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
assistants were, for the most part, men of
local experience and proved activity. The Governor-General
had imparted to the Envoy his ideas of the
manner in which it would be most expedient to employ
them.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> And it may be doubted whether, if the system
itself had not been so radically defective, it would have
ever broken down under the agency which was commissioned
to carry it into effect.</p>

<p>Such, traced in dim outline, were some of the elements
of decay planted deep in the constitution of the
political system which we were attempting to carry out
in Afghanistan. Always of a sanguine temperament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and one whose wish was ever father of his thoughts,
Macnaghten did not see that already the seeds of a great
and sweeping revolution were being sown broadcast across
the whole length and breadth of the land. He was prepared,
and it was right that he should have been, for local
and accidental outbreaks. The Afghans are a turbulent
and lawless people, little inclined to succumb to authority,
and have a rough way of demonstrating their dislikes.
Had he expected the authority of the Shah to be
universally established in a few weeks, the British Envoy
would have manifested a deplorable ignorance of the
national character; but little less was the ignorance
which he manifested, when he believed that the system
of government he was countenancing could ever establish
the country in tranquillity, and the King in the
affections of the people. There were others who saw
clearly that such a system was doomed to set in disaster
and disgrace;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> but Macnaghten, when he accompanied
the Court to Jellalabad, carried with him no forebodings
of evil. He believed that the country was settling down
into quietude under the restored monarchy; and so little,
indeed, did he think that any danger was to be apprehended,
that he encouraged his wife to join him in
Afghanistan, and sent a party of irregular horsemen
under Edward Conolly to escort her from the provinces
of India.</p>

<p>But already was he beginning to have some experience
of the turbulent elements of Afghan society, and the
difficulty of controlling the tribes. In the West, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Ghilzyes had been demonstrating the unruliness of their
nature ever since Shah Soojah re-entered Afghanistan;
and, shortly after his restoration to the Balla Hissar of
Caubul, Captain Outram had been sent out against
them, and had achieved one of those temporary successes
which, in a country like Afghanistan, where blood is
ever crying aloud for blood, can only perpetuate the disquietude
of a disaffected people. And now in the East,
the passes of the Khybur were bristling with the hostile
tribes. The Khybur chiefs had always turned to good
account the difficulties of the passage through their terrible
defiles. They opened the highway in consideration
of certain money-payments from the Caubul rulers.
The sums paid under the Suddozye Kings had been
reduced by the Barukzye Sirdars; but on his restoration,
Shah Soojah, who, in a day of difficulty, had sought and
found a refuge among the Khyburees, now promised to
restore to the tribes the privileges which they had enjoyed
under his fathers. But the Shah had acted in this
matter without the authority or the knowledge of Macnaghten,
and the chiefs were little likely to receive the
amount which the King had agreed to pay to them. Incensed
by what they considered a breach of faith, they
rose up against the small detached parties which Wade
had left at different posts between Peshawur and Jellalabad.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Ali-Musjid was attacked, but not taken.
Ferris, who commanded the garrison, repulsed them with
heavy loss. But a battalion of Nujeebs, entrenched in
the vicinity of the fort, was cut up by an incursion of the
mountaineers.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The appearance of Sir John Keane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
with the residue of the Army of the Indus, quieted for
a time the turbulent tribes. But when the column had
cleared the pass, they harassed the detachments sent to
the relief of Ali-Musjid,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and a force under Colonel
Wheeler was therefore sent out from Jellalabad to overawe
the refractory mountaineers, and support the negotiations
in which Mackeson was engaged. The Khyburees
attacked his baggage, hamstrung his camels, and
thus contrived to sweep some booty into their hands.
Wheeler’s operations were for a time successful; but it
was not until Macnaghten himself appeared on the scene,
and recognised, in view of their formidable defiles, the
expediency of conciliating by sufficient money-payments
these troublesome clans, that they sunk into temporary
quiescence.</p>

<p>It was at Avitabile’s hospitable table in the Goorkhutra
of Peshawur, that Macnaghten received intelligence of the
fall of Khelat. The health of the victors was drunk with
delighted enthusiasm, manifesting itself in the “three
times three” of a good English cheer. All the circumstances
of the capture of the stronghold were discussed
with deep interest to a late hour. It was told how, on
the morning of the 13th of November, General Wiltshire,
with the 2nd and 17th Queen’s Regiments, the 31st
Bengal Native Infantry, with two howitzers, four of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Shah’s six-pounder guns, and a detachment of local horse,
found himself before Khelat. It was plain that Mehrab
Khan was in no mood to submit to the terms dictated to
him. He had at first doubted the intentions of the
British to move against his stronghold, and had been
slow to adopt measures of defence. But when he knew
that our troops were advancing upon Khelat, he prepared
himself, like a brave man, to meet his fate, and flung
defiance at the infidel invaders. Khelat is a place of
commanding strength. The citadel rises high above the
buildings of the town, and frowns menacingly on its assailants.
On the north-west of the fort were three heights,
which the Khan had covered with his infantry, supported
by five guns in position. The engineer officers reported that,
until these heights were carried, it would be impossible
to proceed against the fortress. Orders were then given
for the attack. It was Willshire’s hope that the enemy
might be driven down to the gates of the fortress, and
that our stormers might rush in with them. Gallantly
the hills were carried; gallantly the guns were captured.
The infantry advanced under a heavy fire from the British
artillery. The shrapnel shot from Stevenson’s batteries
fell with too deadly an aim among the Beloochee footmen
for them to hold their position on the hills. They fled
towards the walls of the fortress, and our infantry pushed
hotly after them. But not in time were they to secure
an entrance; the gates were closed against their advance.</p>

<p>The artillery was now brought into play. The infantry,
compelled to protect themselves against the heavy fire
poured in from the rocks, sheltered themselves behind
some ruined buildings, whilst our batteries, planted on
the heights, opened upon the gate and the neighbouring
defences. Two of Cooper’s guns were brought within a
distance of 200 yards; and whilst the gunners fell under
the matchlock fire of the enemy, played full upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
gate. At last it gave way. Pointing his hand towards
the gate, Willshire rode down to show the infantry that
an entrance was ready for them. Rising at once from
their cover, they rushed in with a loud hurrah. Pennycuick
and his men were the first to enter. The other
companies soon followed, until the whole of the storming
column were within the walls of Khelat. Onward they
struggled manfully towards the citadel. Every inch of
ground was obstinately disputed. But at last the citadel
was won. There was a desperate resistance. Sword in
hand, Mehrab Khan and some of his principal chiefs
stood there to give us battle. The Khan himself fell
dead with a musket-ball through his breast. Eight of
his principal ministers and Sirdars fell beside him. From
some inner apartments, of difficult approach, a fire was
still poured in upon our people; and it was not until
Lieutenant Loveday, an assistant of the British agent,
went up to them alone, that they were induced to surrender.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
Loveday received them as prisoners; and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
proceeded to rescue from captivity the aged mother and
other female dependents of an old rival, whose claims
were to be no longer denied.</p>

<p>Nussur Khan, the chief’s son, had fled. A considerable
amount of prize property was collected; an old pretender
to the throne, known as Shah Newaz, who had for some
time been hanging on to the skirts of Shah Soojah and
his allies, was set up in his place; and the provinces of
Shawl, Moostung, and Cutchee, which had long been sentenced
to spoliation, were stripped from the old dominions
of the Khan of Khelat, and annexed to the territories of
Shah Soojah-ool-Moolk. The Shah had been hankering
after an extension of empire; and it was determined that
the much-coveted aggrandisement should be conceded to
him in the direction of Upper Sindh.</p>

<p>It is possible that, whilst all these circumstances were
being narrated and discussed at Avitabile’s dinner-table,
there may have been present one or two officers much
troubled with self-questionings regarding the justice of
these proceedings. But the general opinion, all throughout
Afghanistan and India, was that this Mehrab Khan
had been rightly punished for his offences. Few knew
distinctly what these offences were. There was a general
impression that he had been guilty of acts of indescribable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
treachery; and that during the passage of the British
army through Beloochistan, he was continually molesting
our advancing columns. It was the fashion to attribute
to the wickedness of Mehrab Khan all the sufferings
which afflicted the Army of the Indus on its march to
Candahar, the scarcity which pressed so heavily upon
man and beast, and the depredations of the marauding
Beloochees. The very barrenness of the country, indeed,
was by some laid at his door. It was not very clearly
seen, at this time, that the Army of the Indus was at
least as much the cause, as it was the victim of the
scarcity in Beloochistan. When our troops passed through
the dominions of the Khan of Khelat, there was already,
as has been shown by Burnes’s admissions, a scarcity in
the land; and our vast moving camp increased it. The safe
passage of the Bolan Pass was effected through the friendly
agency of the Brahoo chief. And we have it emphatically,
upon the authority of Macnaghten, that the progress of the
Army of the Indus through the country of Mehrab Khan
was attended by much devastation&mdash;that a great injury
was inflicted upon the people&mdash;and that nothing would
have been easier than for the Khan to have destroyed our
entire force. Such was the language of our diplomatists up
to the end of March; but in April, Burnes recommended
the castigation of the Khan of Khelat; and Mehrab Khan
was doomed to be stripped, on the first convenient opportunity,
of his territory, and deprived either of his liberty
or his life. The evidence of Mehrab Khan’s treachery is
not sufficiently strong to satisfy me that the British
righteously confiscated his principality and sacrificed his
life. He was surrounded by traitors. When his stronghold
was entered, it was seen that the servants he had
trusted had the means of betraying their master; and it
was clear, to all who investigated the charges against
him with judicial impartiality, that he had been betrayed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
It was clear that many of the offences imputed to him
were to be ascribed rather to the machinations of his
secret enemies than to his own enmity and bad faith.
But he had been early doomed to destruction. The
recommendations of the British diplomatists in Afghanistan
had been adopted by the Governor-General; and
the deposition of Mehrab Khan, and the annexation
of Shawl, Moostung, and Cutchee, had been decreed in
the Simlah Council Chamber.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> It was true that Shah
Soojah had, in the hour of need, been succoured by
Mehrab Khan. A statesman in whom the kindly instincts
of humanity were so strong as in Lord Auckland,
was not likely to forget the obligations which so essential
a service at such a time imposed upon the restored
monarch.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> But the graceful suggestion of the Governor-General
was lost; and the Khan lived just long enough
to curse himself for his folly in having opened his arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to receive the Suddozye pretender, when he fled, baffled
and beaten, from the battle-field of Candahar. For that
act of hospitality he paid, five years afterwards, with his
life.</p>

<p>Whether any thoughts of this kind arose to dash the
pleasure of those who toasted the victors of Khelat at
Avitabile’s dinner-table, can only be conjectured; but
all present acknowledged that the capture of Mehrab
Khan’s stronghold was a great military exploit. The
native soldiery are said to have esteemed it more highly
than the capture of Ghuznee, for they had been wisely
allowed to participate in the honour of the exploit.
Sir John Keane had been much censured for composing
his storming column entirely of European companies.
The exclusiveness of the act seemed to imply mistrust
in his Sepoy regiments, and did not raise the
General in the estimation of their officers. It was a
subject, therefore, of general congratulation throughout
the Company’s army, that a Native regiment had shared
with two of the Ghuznee storming corps the glory of
the assault upon Khelat, and had proved themselves well
worthy of the confidence that had been placed in them.</p>

<p>And so Sir John Keane and General Willshire returned
to India. The “Army of the Indus” was broken up,
and soon there came from England the welcome announcement
that the successes of the campaign had been duly
appreciated by the Sovereign, and the chief actors duly
rewarded. Lord Auckland was created an Earl; Sir
John Keane rose up as Baron Keane of Ghuznee; Mr.
Macnaghten took his place in history as Sir William
Macnaghten, Baronet; Colonel Wade became thenceforth
Sir Claude Wade, Knight; and a shower of lesser distinctions,
of brevets and Bath-honours, descended upon
the working officers, whose gallantry had contributed so
largely to the success of this memorable campaign.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">[January-September: 1840.]</p>

Hindoo-Koosh&mdash;Failure of the Russian Expedition&mdash;Conduct of

Conolly.</p>

<p><span class="beg">The</span> King and the Envoy spent the winter at Jellalabad.
There was something like a lull in Afghanistan. When
the snow is on the ground the turbulence of the Afghans
is wont to subside.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The time was favourable for the
consideration of revenue matters, and Macnaghten began
to inquire into the expenditure and the resources of the
kingdom. The inquiry was not a satisfactory one. It
was obvious that the government could be carried on
only by the extraction of large sums from the treasury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of India; and Macnaghten was continually urging the
Supreme Government to authorise the expenditure of
these large sums of money, and continually exhorting the
authorities in the north-western provinces to send him
all the treasure they could spare.</p>

<p>But there was much in the state of our foreign relations
at this time to distract the thoughts of the minister
from the affairs of the home department. The Russian
question was now forcing itself again upon our Indian
statesmen. Even before the Court turned its back upon
Caubul, tidings had been received, in the first instance
from Pottinger at Herat, which left little room to doubt
that a Russian force was about to set out from Orenburgh
on an expedition into Central Asia. The immediate
object of this movement was to threaten the state
of Khiva, which had long been throwing obstacles in the
way of Russian commerce, and carrying off Russian subjects
into hopeless captivity. Russia had been prosecuting
an extensive trade with the countries of Central
Asia; but the state of Khiva which borders on the
country occupied by the Kerghiz Cossacks, was now
declared by the Russian Government to be “daily harassing
the wandering tribes that encamp on our frontiers,
interrupting the intercourse the other states of Asia keep
up with us, detaining the caravans of Bokhara on their
way to and from Russia, obliging them to pay extravagant
duties, and compelling them by main force to pass
through its territory, and there seizing a considerable
portion of their merchandise.” “These insults to
foreigners, holding commercial intercourse with Russia,
are, however,” continues the Russian state-paper&mdash;the
manifesto of the Government of the Czar, declaring the
grounds of their expedition into Central Asia&mdash;“of less
importance than the attacks which have been made on
Russian caravans. Not one of these can now cross the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
desert without danger. It was in this manner that a
Russian caravan from Orenburgh, with goods belonging
to our merchants, was pillaged by the armed bands of
Khiva. No Russian merchant can now venture into
that country without running the risk of losing his life
or being made a prisoner. The inhabitants of Khiva
are constantly making incursions into that part of the
country of the Kerghiz which is at a distance from our
lines, ... and to crown all these insults, they are
detaining several thousand Russian subjects in slavery.
The number of these unfortunate wretches increases
daily, for the peaceful fishermen on the banks of the
Caspian are continually attacked and carried off as slaves
to Khiva.”</p>

<p>Here were plainly and intelligibly set forth the injuries
committed by the state of Khiva against the subjects of
the Russian Government, and the grounds on which the
latter called for redress. Every attempt, it was stated, to
obtain satisfaction for these wrongs, by reason and persuasion,
had failed. It was necessary, therefore, to resort
to more decisive measures. “Every means of persuasion,”
continued the manifesto, “has now been exhausted.
The rights of Russia, the security of her trade, the tranquillity
of her subjects, and the dignity of the state, call
for decisive measures; and the Emperor has judged it to
be time to send a body of troops to Khiva, to put an end
to robbery and exaction, to deliver those Russians who
are detained in slavery, to make the inhabitants of Khiva
esteem and respect the Russian name, and finally to
strengthen in that part of Asia the lawful influence to
which Russia has a right, and which alone can insure the
maintenance of peace. This is the purpose of the present
expedition; and as soon as it shall be attained, and an
order of things conformable to the interests of Russia
and the neighbouring Asiatic states shall be established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
on a permanent footing, the body of troops which has
received orders to march on Khiva will return to the
frontiers of the empire.”</p>

<p>The <i>casus belli</i> was here laid down with sufficient distinctness,
and the facts stated in the manifesto were not
to be denied. But it was believed that Russia had other
objects in view than the liberation of her slaves and the
safety of her commerce; and that if the British army had
not occupied Afghanistan, this manifesto would not have
been issued by the Czar. It was regarded, indeed, as a
counter-movement called forth by our own advance; and
candid men could allege nothing against it on the score
of justice or expediency. There was something suspicious
in the time and manner of its enunciation. But there
was less of aggression and usurpation in it than in our
own manifesto. The movement was justified by the law
of nations. There was outwardly something, indeed, of
positive righteousness in it, appealing to the best instincts
of our nature. And, if there were behind all this outside
show of humanity a politic desire to keep in check
a rival power, that was now intruding in countries far
beyond its own line of frontier, it can only be said that
our own movement into Afghanistan was directed against
a danger of the same kind, but of much less substantial
proportions.</p>

<p>But the expedition of Russia into Central Asia excited
the alarm of our statesmen in Afghanistan, though it did
not rouse their indignation. There was, at all events,
in it much food for anxious consideration. It was the
one great subject of thought and topic of discussion in the
winter of 1839-1840. Burnes, who was left in control
at Caubul, whilst Macnaghten was with the Shah at
Jellalabad, now, with the snow around him, found himself
in the enjoyment of a season of comparative leisure,
able both to think and to write. “What a year has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
been the past,” he wrote to a friend at Bombay, on the
19th of November&mdash;“not to me, I mean, but to our
affairs in the East. Further submission to what was
going on, and our days of supremacy in the East, were
numbered. As it is, we have brought upon ourselves
some additional half-million of annual expenditure, and,
ere 1840 ends, I predict that our frontiers and those of
Russia will touch&mdash;that is, the states dependent upon
either of us will&mdash;and that is the same thing....
Every week brings fresh business; and all the world will
now have it that Russia has advanced on Khiva. What
of that? She has the right to relieve her enslaved
countrymen; and if she have the power, why should she
have so long hesitated? But the time she has chosen
for this blow is an awkward one. I hold, however, that
the man who recommends the cantonment of a British
or an Indian soldier west of the Indus is an enemy to his
country.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>After the lapse of a month, Burnes wrote again to
another correspondent, more emphatically, on the same
subject:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">But everything past and present has been cast into the shade
by the expedition which the Russians have now pushed into
Central Asia. I have known of it for eight weeks past, and had
numerous and authentic reports concerning their waggons, their
<i>matériel</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c., all of which are on a grand scale, giving rise to
serious apprehensions that their plans are not confined to the
chastisement of the petty Khan of Khiva; indeed, our policy at
Herat is already out of joint, and we have reason to know that
Russia from Khiva looks to that city. Her attack on Khiva is
justified by all the laws of nations; and in a country like England,
where slave-dealing is so odiously detested, ought to find favour
in men’s eyes rather than blame. Yet the time chosen wears a
bad appearance, if it at once does not lead to the inference that
Russia has put forth her forces merely to counteract our policy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
This latter is my opinion; and by our advance on Caubul we
have thus hastened the great crisis. England and Russia will
divide Asia between them, and the two empires will enlarge like
the circles in the water till they are lost in nothing; and future
generations will search for both of us in these regions, as we now
seek for the remains of Alexander and his Greeks.</p>

<p>While external affairs stand thus, internal matters are not free
from anxiety. Dost Mahomed’s power is nominally dissolved; but
he has just been invited to Bokhara at the instigation of Russia,
and he hopes to receive Balkh as a gift from the King there; but
in May next we shall occupy Balkh, and if Russia advances beyond
Khiva, be prepared to meet her. Troops are, indeed, warned; but
as we cannot act till May, we shall have abundance of time. As
for withdrawing our army, it is out of the question; for though I
maintain that man to be an enemy to his country who recommends
a soldier to be stationed west of the Indus, what is to be done?
Shah Soojah’s contingent has been hitherto so mismanaged that it
is fit for nothing; and till fit (supposing Russia not to have
appeared), the Shah cannot rely on Afghans. So he says; but if
he will but place British officers over them, pay them regularly
and not interfere with their republican ideas, they would alone
keep this country in order. Now, there is a dose of politics for
you, as verbose as I used to give you when we dined at the house
in Waterloo-place, or when, over a lobster, after some of those
brilliant society meetings in London. My present position is as
follows: I drive the coach in Caubul while Macnaghten is with the
King. On our arrival here, the envoy made a bold push to get
away, he being tired of his place; but the Governor-General
beseeched him to stay a while longer, and appointed your humble
servant resident at Candahar; but this I declined, and I now get
2500 rupees for staying here, though I hope to receive my resident’s
salary. The atrocious crime of being a young man is what
I imagine keeps me <i>en second</i> so long; but I get on well with
Macnaghten, and only want responsibility to be a happy man.</p>

<p>In the Punjab, all is, I am glad to say, wrong. The son has
usurped all real power, and Kuruk Singh is a cypher. I hope
their strife will lead to the evacuation of Peshawur. Events bid
fair for our taking Herat; and then, and not till then, shall we
have restored the Afghan monarchy.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Less heavily on Macnaghten’s mind sate the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of this Russian invasion. Other and nearer sources of
inquietude troubled him at this time. In whatsoever
direction he turned his eyes, he was glared at by some
great trouble. Everything was going wrong. At Herat,
Yar Mahomed was playing a game of unexampled treachery.
In the remote regions of Central Asia, a British envoy was
groaning under the tyranny of the unscrupulous Ameer
of Bokhara. Nearer home, the measures of the double
government in Afghanistan were beginning to bear their
own bitter fruits. At Candahar, the Douranees were
chafing under the exactions of unpopular revenue-officers.
In the Kohistan, already were those, who had revolted, in
a critical hour, against Dost Mahomed, and contributed
largely to his expulsion from Afghanistan, sighing for his
return. And further down towards the South, the country
which we had made the burial-place of Mehrab Khan, was
breaking out into rebellion against the authority which
we had attempted to establish; while the Sikhs, to whom
we had conceded so much, our associates in the Tripartite
Treaty, were unscrupulously intriguing against us.</p>

<p>All these things were against him. It was plain that
he was among a people of a very different stamp from
those with whom he had been connected throughout the
earlier years of his administrative career. There was
much to disquiet his mind, to engage his thoughts, and to
occupy his time. One after another he passed in review
before him all the difficulties which beset his path; but
there was nothing that pressed more heavily on his mind,
or which seemed to arouse him into intenser action, than
the outrages to which Colonel Stoddart had been subjected
at Bokhara.</p>

<p>Stoddart had been at Bokhara ever since the close of
the year 1838. He had been despatched by Mr. M’Neill
to that Court, with instructions to obtain the liberation
of all the Russians pining there in captivity, and to conclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a friendly treaty with the Ameer. His reception,
though marked by some caprice, was not altogether uncourteous.
He was very ignorant of the customs of the
country, and was inclined to resent as insults the exaction
of formalities in accordance with the ordinary usages of
Bokhara. He seems to have made no effort to win the
favour of the barbarous monarch by the adoption of a conciliatory
demeanour; but somehow or other he scrambled
through the first ceremonials without giving the Commander
of the Faithful any mortal offence.</p>

<p>But it would appear that he soon excited the bitter
enmity of the Reiss, or minister. His letters had been
addressed to the predecessor of this man. The old minister
had been disgraced whilst Stoddart was on his way to
Bokhara, and the new man was little inclined to regard
with favour the Feringhee who had sought the protection
of the old. In a very short time, Stoddart, having been
invited to the residence of the Reiss, was suddenly seized,
thrown to the ground, bound with cords, and threatened
with death by the minister himself, who stood over him
with a long knife. He was then carried out, on a dark
rainy night, into the streets, hurried from place to place,
by torchlight, and at last lowered down by ropes into a
dark well, swarming with the most nauseous vermin, to
be the companion of murderers and thieves. In this
wretched dungeon, weakened both in body and in mind
by long-continued suffering, he consented outwardly to
conform to the ceremonials of the Mahomedan faith.</p>

<p>After two months of extreme suffering, Stoddart was
released from this dreadful dungeon. The chief officer of
police then received him into his house; and from this
time, throughout the year 1839, though subject to the
caprices of a tyrannous monarch and an unscrupulous
minister, and the insults of barbarians of less note, his
condition on the whole was bettered. The success of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
British in Afghanistan seemed for a time to awaken the
Ameer to a just sense of the power of the British nation,
and Stoddart rose into importance at the Bokhara Court,
as the agent of a powerful state, capable of exercising a
mighty influence over the destinies of Central Asia. But
the caprices of this barbarous potentate were great. The
smiles of to-day were followed by the cruelties of the
morrow. Stoddart continued a prisoner at Bokhara; and
Macnaghten, sympathising with the sufferings of a brave
officer, and eager to chastise the insolent barbarity of
the petty Central-Asian tyrant, again contemplated the
despatch of a brigade across the mountains of the Hindoo-Koosh.</p>

<p>It was necessary, however, to tread cautiously on this
ground. There were more reasons than one why Macnaghten,
at this time, turned his thoughts towards Bokhara.
Dost Mahomed had sought an asylum at the
Ameer’s Court.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The “Commander of the Faithful,” as
this rude Mussulman potentate ostentatiously termed himself,
received the fugitive with open arms. For a little
while he lavished upon the fallen Prince all the benignities
of oriental hospitality; and then laid his heavy hand upon
him, and made him a prisoner.</p>

<p>“It seems certain that the Dost has got into bad odour
at Bokhara,” wrote Macnaghten to Burnes, on the 20th
of February, “and it is very improbable that the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Ameers-ool-Moomuneen will ever act cordially together.”
It was the policy of our British diplomatists, at this time,
to keep the two Ameers in a state of disunion and antagonism.
But the very course which Macnaghten was
disposed to pursue towards Bokhara, was that of all others
which was most surely calculated to cement an alliance
between them. A military expedition against Bokhara
would, in all probability, have induced the Khan to release
Dost Mahomed, and to supply him with the means of
crossing the frontier at the head of an imposing body of
fighting men, and, aided by the Wullee of Khooloom and
other chiefs of the Oosbeg hill states, making an effort to
regain his lost dominions. There was something, too, in
the alleged cause of Dost Mahomed’s confinement at
Bokhara, which made Macnaghten waver still more in his
determination to send an army across the Hindoo-Koosh,
and suggested to him the expediency of devoting himself
to the furtherance of objects of another kind. It was said
that the Ameer of Bokhara was greatly incensed by Dost
Mahomed’s practical refusal to summon his family to that
city. They had remained under the charge of Jubbar
Khan, in the hospitable territory of the Wullee of
Khooloom; and it was reported that the Khan of Bokhara
had declared, that if they sought the protection of the
British Government, he would destroy Dost Mahomed.
But Jubbar Khan was well disposed at this time to seek
from the British an honourable asylum for his brother’s
family; and the question of their reception was earnestly
pondered by Macnaghten, and discussed with the Shah.
In the middle of February, he wrote to Burnes, from
Jellalabad, that although common hospitality required
that an asylum should not be refused to persons “in so
distressed a plight as the Dost’s family;” but that, at the
same time, common prudence required that in the exercise
of this office of humanity, we should not expose ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to the machinations of perfidious enemies. He suggested
therefore, that Dr. Lord, in reply to any request on the
subject, should say that a safe and honourable asylum
would be granted to the Ameer’s family on condition of
their residing wherever our government might think
proper to locate them.</p>

<p>But stolid, selfish, and remorseless towards his enemies,
Shah Soojah was not easily to be persuaded that either
humanity or policy demanded that he should grant an
asylum or a maintenance to Dost Mahomed’s family, and
declared that nothing short of absolute force would induce
him to contribute a rupee towards their support. The
vicissitudes of his past life had only hardened the King’s
heart, and often as he had sought an “asylum” himself,
he had now, in the day of prosperity, no bowels of compassion
for the fugitive and the suppliant. On the English
envoy, however, the obduracy of Shah Soojah had little
effect, and he still declared that the family of Dost
Mahomed were entitled to kind and honourable treatment
at our hands. This justice and humanity required, whilst
it seemed also to Macnaghten to be sound policy to hold
out every inducement to the Ameer to commit his family
to our charge. In that case, he wrote to Burnes, the Shah
of Bokhara could make no use of Dost Mahomed, and the
objection to the movement into Toorkistan would be
obviated. “Let us examine,” he added, “what we are to
gain by such a movement, and upon what principles it
should be conducted. The first thing to be gained is the
punishment of the Shah of Bokhara, for his frequent and
outrageous violation of the law of nations, and the release
of our agent, Colonel Stoddart, who, without some exertion
on our part, will, it is likely, be doomed to incarceration
for life. I suppose the expedition to be conveniently
feasible, if entered upon at the proper season of the year.
What Timour Shah effected, we can do; and with proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
arrangement we may either enlist on our side, or keep
neutral, the chiefs between us and Bokhara. If we
compelled the Shah of Bokhara to release Stoddart, to
evacuate all the countries on this side of the Oxus, and
to pay the expenses of the expedition, we should have
achieved all that is desirable.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The Court remained at Jellalabad up to the third week
of April; and the excursive mind of the Envoy was still
wandering out in the wild regions beyond the Hindoo-Koosh.
It was certain that a Russian army was advancing
upon Khiva. In the country about Khooloom the adherents
of Dost Mahomed were exciting against us the
hostility of the Oosbegs. Jubbar Khan, with the Ameer’s
family and a large party of retainers, were there. The
petty chiefs beyond the mountains were in a state of
doubtful vassalage, scarcely knowing whether they were
subject to Herat or to Caubul; whether they would
recognise the Khan of Bokhara or the Khan of Khiva as
their suzerain; or whether they would be, in effect, independent
of all.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It was desirable to annex these Cis-Oxus
principalities to the territory of the Shah, to strengthen our
frontier, and keep them out of the hands of the Bokhara
ruler. Already was there a weak detachment wintering
amid the inhospitable snows of Bameean. The despatch
of a strong brigade to the country beyond was still among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the cherished projects of the Envoy. Writing from Jellalabad,
he turned his back upon the southern passes, and
looking out across the northern Caucasian mountains,
declared that it was easier to march on Bokhara than to
subjugate the tribes of the Khybur. To the Governor of
Agra he thus addressed himself on the 1st of April, “A
brigade of ours, with a due proportion of artillery, would,
I think, from all I have heard, be fully competent to overcome
any opposition that could be offered to us between
this and Bokhara. I do not think that we should incur
the risk of the movement solely for the purpose of reannexing
the Cis-Oxus provinces to the dominions of his Majesty
Shah Soojah; though if they are not so re-annexed, Bokhara,
at the instigation of Russia, will certainly assert a real
supremacy. At present she has only Balkh and its
dependencies, and her sway over that even is but nominal.
But we cannot allow Dost Mahomed’s family to occupy so
commanding a position as Khooloom, close to the Afghan
frontier. And may not the contingency upon which the
home authorities direct an advance, be said to have arisen
should the Russians establish themselves in force at
Bokhara?”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>It was, indeed, a great game on which Macnaghten was
then intent&mdash;a game so vast that the subjugation of the
Punjab and Nepaul was regarded as a petty contribution
to its success. These grand schemes dazzled him, and he
could not see the dangers which grew at his feet.</p>

<p>“I intend,” he wrote in the letter above quoted, “sending
Arthur Conolly, who has joined me here, and Rawlinson
on a mission to Kokan, with a view, if possible, to frustrate
the knavish tricks of the <i>Russe log</i> in that quarter.
Though there are doubtless many of the elements of mischief
in this country, yet I should not apprehend any
internal explosion, even if the greater portion of our troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
were withdrawn. Depend upon it we shall never be at
our ease in India until we have subjugated the Punjab
and Nepaul; and the sooner we can come to a reckoning
with our faithful allies the Singhs, the better. They are
doing all they can to injure us in this quarter, and are
comforting all the rebels and parties disaffected to his
Majesty Shah Soojah. We should here have no difficulty
in dealing with them in this quarter, and I will venture to
say there would not be a disciple of Nanuk on this side
the Indus a week after the declaration of hostilities.”</p>

<p>As the month advanced, the intelligence from the
North was more and more calculated to rivet the opinion
entertained by Burnes and others of the success of the
Russian expedition,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and Macnaghten began to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that the danger was greater than he had once believed.
“Unless,” he wrote at the end of April, “Lord Auckland
act with vigour and promptitude to secure and open our
rear, we shall soon be between two fires&mdash;if not under
them. France and Russia are advancing with only the
remote contingency of profit to stimulate them. We are
supine, whilst our inactivity will probably be the cause
of our ruin. France gratuitously supplies Persia with
30,000 muskets, at a time when Persia may be said to be
at war with us. I cannot, though I have repeatedly and
earnestly pressed my request, obtain a single musket.”</p>

<p>A fortnight after this letter was written, the Envoy
proposed to Burnes that he should proceed on a mission
to the Russian camp. “He said, he would willingly go if
ordered&mdash;but that,” added Macnaghten, “is not the spirit
which should animate our Elchee;” and the design was
abandoned. It must have been very soon after this<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
that the glad tidings of the break-down of the Russian
expedition reached the Court of Shah Soojah. The Envoy
had spoken despondingly of the contemptible enemy
which the Russian army had to encounter. But there was
an enemy of which no account was taken&mdash;an enemy that
had destroyed one of Napoleon’s finest armies, and which
was doomed to overthrow utterly our own policy in Central
Asia&mdash;spreading its toils around Peroffski’s advancing
columns. The Snow was doing its work.</p>

<p>On the 13th of March, the failure of the expedition
was announced in the public journals of St. Petersburgh,
and Lord Clanricarde, on the same day, sent the intelligence
to Lord Palmerston. The journals announced that
the intense cold, the deep snow, and the inaccessibility of
the country, had destroyed the camels, and compelled the
army to retrace its steps. But the actual truth was worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
than the newspaper history; for Peroffski’s ill-fated army
had been attacked by pestilence and famine.</p>

<p>As the year wore on, Macnaghten’s difficulties seemed
to thicken around him. The failure of the Russian expedition
removed one source of inquietude; but it was a
remote one. And nearer home, many great dangers were
bristling up in his path. Still immersed, however, in
foreign politics, the Envoy gave little heed to the domestic
troubles which were environing him. His thoughts were
continually ranging beyond the limits of Shah Soojah’s
dominions; and whilst the edifice he had reared was falling
to pieces by the force of its own innate corruptness,
he was devising measures of external defence.</p>

<p>During the spring and the early summer months two
subjects pressed urgently on his attention, and became
the burdens of his discourse. The one was the conduct
of the Sikhs; the other, the state of affairs at Herat.
Ever since the death of Runjeet Singh, the temper of the
Lahore Durbar had been such as to impress the Envoy
strongly with the conviction that nothing but decisive
measures would ever bring our allies to regard the terms
of the Tripartite Treaty. The real ruler of the Punjab
was the young and impetuous Prince, Nao Nehal Singh,
who had almost set aside the authority of his imbecile
father, and was longing for the day when he might take
more openly and undisguisedly the sceptre into his hands.
In every possible way our allies had evaded the stipulations
of the treaty. They had rendered no effectual aid
to Prince Timour in the operations which, conjointly
with Wade, he had undertaken for the recovery of his
father’s throne. They were making light of the obligation
to support a contingent force of Sikh troops on the
frontier, in return for the subsidy granted by the treaty;
and proof had been afforded that they were engaged in
treasonable correspondence with our enemies in Afghanistan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
It is certain, at least, that they were harbouring at
their frontier stations the rebel Ghilzye chiefs, who had
been driven out of Shah Soojah’s territory, and suffering,
if not aiding, them to return again to foment new disturbances.
Sultan Mahomed Khan and his brothers at
Peshawur were servants of the Maharajah, but they were
Barukzyes still; and it was not strange that they regarded
with undisguised satisfaction the clouds which were gathering
over the restored Suddozye monarchy.</p>

<p>But more important still than these considerations, was
the question which had now arisen regarding the free
passage of our troops and convoys through the dominions
of Lahore. It was obvious that we could not maintain
our position in Afghanistan so long as the Punjab stood
impassable between that country and Hindostan. But
Nao Nehal Singh and the Kalsa viewed with insurmountable
jealousy the passage of our armaments through the
Punjab. They declared, that when Mr. Clark negotiated
for a passage for the troops returning from the expedition
into Afghanistan, the accorded permission was limited to
that especial case, and was by no means intended to
convey a general license for the repeated crossings and
recrossings which now seemed to be in contemplation.
But Macnaghten declared that it was absolutely necessary
to “macadamise” the road though the Punjab; and
the authorities at Calcutta began to think that a war with
the Sikhs was no improbable event.</p>

<p>Parallel with these inquietudes arising out of the conduct
of the Lahore Durbar and its agents, ran the troubles
which weighed upon Macnaghten’s mind in connexion
with the ill-omened aspect of affairs at Herat. The insolent
ingratitude of Yar Mahomed had reached a pitch of
sublime daring. The British Government were lavishing
their treasures upon Herat; and the chief minister of
Herat, in return for this support, was insulting the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
officers, and intriguing with the Persian Court. It has
been stated that in the month of June, 1839, Major
D’Arcy Todd had been despatched on a special mission to
Herat. He was instructed to conclude a treaty of friendship
with Shah Kamran; to ascertain the causes of the
dissatisfaction of the Heratee Court with the British
Government; to conciliate the good will of Yar Mahomed,
and to wean him from his Persian intrigues, by assuring
him of our friendly disposition towards him, and of our
desire to support his administration; to determine, if
possible, the boundaries between Shah Kamran’s and
Shah Soojah’s dominions; to aid the Heratee Government
with money, and to strengthen the fortifications of the
place. This accomplished, he was to have joined the Court
of Shah Soojah, leaving Pottinger, whose authority he was
not to have superseded, to carry on the ordinary duties of
the Agency. But the young Bombay Artilleryman had
availed himself of the occasion of Todd’s presence at Herat
to obtain leave of absence, and visit the British provinces;
and the latter had consented to remain in his place.</p>

<p>The task which had been entrusted to Major Todd he
had performed, as far as such a task was one of possible
performance, with no common address; and being a man
of enlarged humanity, with a high sense of his duty as a
Christian officer, he had exerted himself to render the
presence of the British Mission at Herat a blessing to the
oppressed and suffering people. But it was not possible to
change the nature of Yar Mahomed; to make him either
grateful or true. In the history of human infamy there is
nothing more infamous than the conduct of this man. The
treaty between the British Government and the state of
Herat, by which the latter bound itself not to enter into
negotiations with other states without the knowledge and
consent of the British Resident, had only been signed a
few weeks, when Yar Mahomed was detected in carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
on a correspondence with the Persian Asoof-ood-Dowlah at
Meshed, offering to place himself and his country under
the protection of the Persian Government, and inviting
him to enter into a league for the expulsion of the infidel
English from Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Up to this time eight lakhs of rupees had been advanced
to the Heratee Government. When the new year
dawned upon Herat, twelve lakhs had been so advanced.
The utmost benefits had been conferred upon
the state. The measures of our British officers had rescued
“King, chiefs, and people from starvation.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> But at this
very time a letter was addressed to Mahomed Shah of
Persia, in the name of Shah Kamran, declaring the
Heratee ruler to be the faithful servant of the Shah-in-Shah;
and setting forth that he only tolerated the presence
of the English because they were useful to him&mdash;that,
in truth, they were not niggardly with their money;
but that the hopes of his Majesty were in the asylum of Islam.</p>

<p>In explanation of this black-hearted treachery it is
said that the apprehensions of Yar Mahomed had been
excited by the imposing attitude of Great Britain in
Afghanistan&mdash;that he looked upon the danger to be
apprehended from the contiguity of the British army as
something less remote and more alarming than the return
of Mahomed Shah; and that it was his policy at this
time to play off one state against another, and to secure
the good offices of Persia, whilst openly receiving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
bounties of Great Britain. This is, doubtless, the view
in which the matter is to be regarded with reference to
the case of Yar Mahomed, the statesman. He was not
incapable of taking a statesmanlike view of the position
of his principality. He understood the interests of Herat.
But better still did he understand the interests of Yar
Mahomed. The presence of the English officers at Herat
was a burden and a reproach to the Wuzeer. He hated
their interference; he had no sympathy with their high-toned
notions of humanity&mdash;with their horror of slavery&mdash;with
their compassion for the weak and oppressed. He
had thriven best in bad times; he had found the sufferings
of the people serviceable to him. The <i>surveillance</i>
of the British Mission impeded the exercise of his arbitrary
desire to enrich himself at the expense of his poorer
countrymen. So he hated Pottinger; he hated Todd; he
hated every high-minded Englishman. But he bore with
them for their money. Todd’s measures were especially
distasteful to him. The effort which he was making to
break down the accursed slave-trade of Central Asia, was
more obnoxious than everything beside.</p>

<p>Associated with Todd&mdash;an Artillery officer&mdash;were two
other subalterns of Artillery&mdash;James Abbott and Richmond
Shakespear. They were men of ability, of enthusiasm,
and of high courage. Abbott’s mind was of a more
imaginative and romantic cast than that of his associate,
who had qualities of a more serviceable kind, more practical,
and more judicious. Both were men sure to carry
out any duty, however hazardous, entrusted to them, in a
conscientious and intrepid manner. They were well inclined
for any kind of personal adventure; and, ardent in the
pursuit of knowledge, were eager to explore new countries,
to mix with an unfamiliar people, and to visit uncivilised
courts. When, therefore, Todd, acquainted with
the menacing attitude which Russia had assumed towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the Court of Khiva, and the declared grounds of her
Central-Asian expedition, recognised the expediency of
despatching a British officer to the capital of the Khan
Huzzrut, to mediate for the liberation of the Russian
slaves in captivity there, he was fortunate in having at
his elbow two men, to either of whom he might securely
entrust the charge of a mission at once hazardous and
delicate. In December, 1840, Abbott, who was the
senior of the two, was hastily despatched to the Court
of Khiva.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The Khivan ruler, then awaiting in alarm
the approach of the Muscovite battalions, yet not altogether
unsuspicious of the forward movements of the
British, was well-inclined to receive the Mission; but
Yar Mahomed had set at work the same dark intrigues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
which had caused Colonel Stoddart to be cast into captivity
at Bokhara, and was doing his best to thwart the
humane efforts of the British artilleryman. He seems
to have had an instinctive hatred of men who were exerting
themselves to sweep away the foul slave-marts of
Central Asia.</p>

<p>With deep and painful interest Macnaghten watched
the progress of events at Herat. The perfidy of Yar
Mahomed was so glaring&mdash;so unblushing&mdash;that the Envoy
had not hesitated to recommend offensive proceedings
against the state of Herat, to be followed by its re-annexation
to the dominions of Shah Soojah. But Lord Auckland
when the proposal first came before him, was disinclined
to embrace it. He thought it better to forgive
Yar Mahomed; and make a further experiment upon the
gratitude of the Wuzeer. So, instead of an army, as
Macnaghten eagerly recommended, a further supply of
money was sent to Herat; and Yar Mahomed continued
to intrigue with the Persian Government.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>It seemed to the Envoy, at this time, that there was
no middle course to be pursued. All through our Central-Asian
policy, indeed, there ran two substantive ideas.
It was either the bayonet or the money-bag that was to
settle everything for us. When Macnaghten found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the rulers of Herat were not to be dragooned into propriety,
he declared that there was nothing left for us now
but to bribe them. He proposed that a subsidy of two
or three lakhs per annum should be granted to Herat;
that guns, muskets, and ordnance stores in abundance
should be furnished to the state; and in the meanwhile
he continued to send up more treasure, with a profusion
which startled the Calcutta Government, to be expended
on the strengthening of its defences and the sustentation
of the people.</p>

<p>But as the treachery of Yar Mahomed became more
fully developed, the Governor-General began to mistrust
the efficacy of the course of forbearance and conciliation
which he had in the first instance recommended. He had
authorised Major Todd to declare his forgiveness of all
past offences, and was willing to enter upon a new covenant
of friendship, <i>rasâ tabulâ</i>, with the offending state.
But he was not then acquainted with the fact of the letter
to Mahomed Shah, in which, with almost unexampled
shamelessness, the writer boasted of the cajolery practised
upon the English, who lavished their money freely upon
Herat, whilst its rulers were flinging themselves into the
arms of Persia; for although that letter had been written
in January, and came, therefore, within the margin of
those offences for which forgiveness had been declared, it
was not until some time afterwards that this crowning act
of perfidy was discovered and laid bare before the Governor-General.
Then it would seem that Lord Auckland began
to waver in his resolution to maintain the independence of
Herat. But he was at this time resident at Calcutta.
Sir Jasper Nicolls,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> who had held the chief command at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Madras, an old and distinguished officer, who had done
good service in the Nepaul war, and was possessed of an
amount of Indian experience almost unexampled in an
Indian Commander-in-Chief, was at the Presidency. The
war in Afghanistan had been extremely distasteful to him
from the beginning, and he now viewed with suspicion
and alarm all the projects which were passing before him
for the despatch of more troops and the diversion of more
treasure from their legitimate purposes in Hindostan. No
warlike promptings, therefore, from the military side of
the Council Chamber, ever stimulated Lord Auckland to
bury his legions in the inhospitable defiles of Afghanistan,
or to waste the finances of India in insane attempts to
change the nature of the chiefs and people of Central
Asia, and to bribe them into quiescence and peace.</p>

<p>But ever was it the burden of Macnaghten’s letters,
that he could do nothing with Afghanistan until Yar
Mahomed and the Sikhs had been chastised; and Herat
on the one side, and Peshawur on the other, re-annexed to
the Douranee Empire. How strongly he felt on these
points may be gathered both from the public and private
letters which, in the summer of 1840, he despatched from
Caubul to his correspondents in different parts of India<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and Afghanistan. “This,” he wrote to the Governor-General
on the 20th of July, “if the means are available,
appears to me the time for accomplishing the great work
which your Lordship has commenced, and of effectually
frustrating the designs of Russia. Herat should now be
taken possession of in the name of Shah Soojah. To leave
it in the hands of its present possessors, after the fresh
proofs of treachery and enmity towards us which they
have displayed, would, in my humble opinion, be most
dangerous. Herat may be said to be the pivot of all
operations affecting the safety of our possessions and our
interests in the East, and thence Balkh and Bokhara would
be at all times accessible. The Sikhs should no longer be
suffered to throw unreasonable obstacles in the way of our
just and necessary objects, and if they really feel (as they
are bound by treaty to do) an interest in the success of
our operations, they should not object to the passage of
our troops, or even to their location in the Punjab, should
such a measure be deemed conducive to the welfare of us
both. Your Lordship will, I feel assured, forgive the
freedom of these remarks. I am convinced that one grand
effort will place the safety of our interests on a firm and
solid basis.... I shall only add, that should
offensive operations against Herat be undertaken, I should
not entertain the smallest doubt of their complete and
speedy success, especially as we should have many friends
in the country.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> “We have a beautiful game on our
hands,” he wrote in another letter, “if we have the
means and inclination to play it properly. Our advance
upon Herat would go far to induce the Russian government
to attend to any reasonable overtures on the part of
the Khan of Khiva.”</p>

<p>And so still was Macnaghten’s cry ever for more money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and more bayonets, that he might play the “beautiful
game” of knocking down and setting up kingdoms and
principalities, with which it became us not to interfere, to
the waste of the resources, and the sacrifice of the interests
of those whom Providence had especially committed to
our care.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, in the dominions of Shah Soojah
everything was going wrong. Macnaghten still professed
his belief in the popularity of the King, and was unwilling
to acknowledge that the people were not in a state of
repose. But every now and then, both in Afghanistan
itself, and in the country that had been wrested from
Mehrab Khan, awkward evidences of the unsettled state
of the country rose up to proclaim far and wide the fact,
that there was little loyalty in men’s minds towards the
Shah, and little affection for his foreign supporters. The
Ghilzyes, whom in the preceding autumn Captain Outram
had attacked, and, it was said, reduced, were now again
rebelling in Western Afghanistan. The chiefs had fled to
Peshawur, had been harboured there during the winter,
and now, on the return of the spring, had been slipped
from their retreat, strengthened, it was believed, by Sikh
gold. At all events, in the month of April they were
actively employed raising the tribes and cutting off our
communications between Candahar and Caubul. General
Nott had by this time assumed the command of the troops
at the former place&mdash;a place with which his name has
since become imperishably associated. Under-rating the
strength of the “rebels,” as all were then called who did
not appreciate the new order of things which the British
had established in Afghanistan, he sent out a party of
200 horsemen, under Captains Walker and Tayler, to
clear the road. But the detachment was not strong
enough for the purpose. It was necessary to reinforce
them. Nott had some good officers about him, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
had not one better than Captain William Anderson, of
the Bengal Artillery, commandant of the Shah’s Horse
Artillery at Candahar. So, on the 6th of May, the General
sent for Anderson, and asked him whether he could prepare
himself to march on the following morning, with a
regiment of foot, four guns, and 300 horsemen. Anderson
answered promptly that the artillery were always ready,
and that he would do his best. By seven o’clock on the
following morning the detachment was under arms and
ready for the march. On the 14th they came up with
Tayler and Walker, in the neighbourhood of the Turnuk
river. The Ghilzyes were about eight miles distant,
variously reported at from 600 to 3000 men. Anderson’s
cattle were exhausted; so he halted, and to gain time,
opened negotiations with the enemy. The answer sent
back by the chiefs was a gallant one. They said, that
they had 12,000 men&mdash;a firm faith in God and in the
justice of their cause&mdash;and that they would fight. So
Anderson prepared to attack them. Detaching his cavalry
to the right and left, he moved down, on the 16th, with
his infantry and his guns, and, after a march of some five
miles, found the enemy about 2000 strong, occupying
some hills in his front. The action was a gallant one on
both sides. Twice the enemy charged. The first charge
was repulsed by a heavy fire from Turner’s guns&mdash;the
second was met at the point of the bayonet by Spence’s
infantry. Anderson, after the first march from Candahar,
beguiled by some accounts of the retirement of the enemy,
had sent back the greater part of the cavalry with which
he had started; so that he was weak in that arm. But
for this, he would have cut up the enemy with heavy
slaughter. As it was, the victory was complete. The
enemy fled and betook themselves to their mountain fastnesses,
whilst Anderson re-formed column and marched
on to take up a good position above Olan Robat. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
country around was quieted for a time by this victory;
but disaffection was not rooted out. Indeed, every action
of this kind only increased the bitter animosity of the
Ghilzyes, and established unappeasable blood-feuds between
our people and the tribes.</p>

<p>But the money-bag was now brought in to complete
what the bayonet had commenced. It was expedient to
conciliate the Ghilzyes, who had at any time the power of
cutting off our communications between Candahar and
Caubul; and Macnaghten, therefore, recommended the
payment of an annual stipend to the chiefs,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> on condition
that they would restrain their followers from infesting
the highways. But neither the bayonet nor the money-bag
could keep these turbulent tribes in a continued state
of repose.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>At the same time, the state of the southern provinces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
was such as to excite painful disquietude in Macnaghten’s
mind. The tract of country which, after the capture of
Khelat, had been annexed, by the fiat of the Indian
Government, to the territory of Shah Soojah, was perpetually
breaking out into fierce spasms of unrest. It
had been almost entirely denuded of British troops; and
small detachments were sent here and there, or solitary
political agents sate themselves down, with only a handful
of fighting men at command, as though all their paths
were pleasantness and peace, and all their homes bowers
of repose. But the Beloochees neither liked their new
chief nor his European supporters. The blood of Mehrab
Khan was continually crying out against the usurpation.
Ever and anon opportunity offered, and it was not
neglected. One officer,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> on his way from the fort of
Kahun with a convoy of camels, was overwhelmed and
destroyed by the Beloochees. Kahun was invested by
the Murrees. Quettah was besieged by the Khaukurs.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
It was soon apparent that the whole country was in revolt.
The youthful son of Mehrab Khan was in the field. The
tribes were flocking around him. The chief who had
been set up in his place was at Khelat. Lieutenant
Loveday was with him. The defences of the place were
miserably out of repair. The garrison mainly consisted of
the chief’s own people. There were scarcely any means
of resistance at their command, when the wild tribes,
headed by the family of Nussur Khan, came crowding
around the walls of Khelat. The new chief was staunch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and true. But there were traitors and evil counsellors in
the fort, and Loveday listened to bad advice. No succours
could be sent to his relief, for our other positions in
Upper Sindh were threatened by the hostile tribes. And
so it happened that, after some days of beleaguerment,
Khelat fell to the Brahoo chiefs.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Newaz Khan abdicated
in favour of the youthful son of the prince who had
fallen in the defence of his stronghold; Loveday was
made a prisoner; and when some months afterwards, a
detachment of British troops advanced to the relief of
Dadur, which had been attacked by the enemy, the unfortunate
young officer was found in the deserted camp of
the Brahoos, chained to a camel-pannier, half naked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
emaciated, and dead. His throat had just been cut by
the sabre of a Beloochee horseman.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>But in spite of all these indications of unrest&mdash;&mdash;these
signs of the desperate unpopularity of the restored
monarchy&mdash;&mdash;Macnaghten clung to the belief that the
country was settling down under the rule of Shah Soojah,
and never ceased to represent to Lord Auckland and his
secretaries that there were no grounds for uneasiness or
alarm. He was, indeed, most anxious to remove any
impressions of an opposite character which may have
forced themselves upon the minds of the Governor-General
and his advisers. On the 8th of July he wrote to
Mr. Colvin, saying; “You tell me that my letter has
left a very painful impression upon you, as manifesting
my sense of the weakness of the royal cause. I fear I
must have written my mind to very little purpose regarding
the state of this country. You rightly conjecture
that the Barukzyes have most ‘inflammable material to
work upon.’ Of all moral qualities, avarice, credulity,
and bigotry, are the most inflammable, and the Afghans
have all these three in perfection. They will take Sikh
gold, they will believe that Shah Soojah is nobody, and
they will esteem it a merit to fight against us. When,
in addition to these inducements, there has been positively
no government in the country for the last thirty years,
it will cease to be wondered at that commotion can easily
be raised by intriguers possessing a long contiguity of
frontier, and having, besides, all the means and appliances
to ensure success. Though our presence here, doubtless,
strengthens Shah Soojah, it must be remembered that in
some sense it weakens him. There is no denying that
he has been supported by infidels; and were we not here,
he would adopt Afghan means of suppressing disturbances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
such as we could not be a party to. To break faith with
a rebel is not deemed a sin by the most moral Afghan;
and assassination was an every day occurrence. By the
encouragement of blood-feuds, it is notorious that Dost
Mahomed propped up the little power he had beyond the
gates of Caubul.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>It vexed Macnaghten’s spirit to think that he could
not infuse into other British officers in Afghanistan some
of his own overflowing faith in the popularity of the Shah,
or his own respect for the royal person. From the very
outset of the campaign the popular feeling throughout
the army had been strong against Shah Soojah, and the
conduct of his Majesty himself had not tended to lessen
it.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> And the worst of it was, that all kinds of stories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
about the haughty exclusiveness of the Shah, and
the low estimation in which he was held both by the
British officers and by his own subjects, were perpetually
making their way to Government House, and there
finding ready acceptance. It irritated Macnaghten to
receive letters from Colvin, commenting on failure, and
hinting at mismanagement in Afghanistan. At last his
patience gave way, and on the 4th of August he wrote to
the Private Secretary, bitterly complaining of the attention
paid by Government to the stories of persons afflicted with
the “imposthume of too much leisure,” who, he said,
were daily fabricating the grossest falsehoods against his
Majesty and the authorities, as the supposed cause of
their detention in a land “not overflowing with beer and
cheroots.” “The Shah,” he added, “is conciliatory in the
extreme to all his chiefs. He listens with the greatest
patience to all their requests and representations, however
unreasonable, and he cannot bear to give any of them a
direct refusal on any occasion. You have been told that
he is a ruler who seeks to get on ‘without trusting,
rewarding, or punishing’ any of his own people. It is
nonsense upon the face of it, and is contradicted by every
hour’s experience. I have nothing more to say about his
Majesty’s character than I have already said. I believe
him to be the best and ablest man in his kingdom. The
history of the revenues of this poor country may be given
in a few words. The whole is consumed in the pay of the
priesthood, the soldiery, and the support of his Majesty’s
household. You shall have the particulars of these as
soon as I can get half an hour’s leisure. You know we
are solemnly bound to refrain from interference in the
internal administration; and, in my advice, I have been
cautious to urge no innovations which could, at this early
stage of our connection with them, shock the prejudices of
the people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now, my dear Colvin,” continued the vexed envoy,
“you must allow me to disburden my mind to you. I
have perceived, or fancied I perceived, on several occasions
lately, a want of confidence in my proceedings, and a
disposition to listen to every unfavourable report regarding
affairs in this quarter; whilst I do not receive that support
to which the overwhelming difficulties of my position
entitle me.” He then adverted to a controversy which,
he said, had been “thrust upon him” by Brigadier Roberts,
who commanded the Shah’s force. There had been from
the first a jealousy, almost amounting to a conflict of
authority, between the envoy and the brigadier. It was
often difficult to observe the just frontier-line between the
military and the political, and each had chafed under the
supposed interference of the other. The soldier, whose
imagination did not colour affairs in Afghanistan with the
roseate hues which flushed everywhere the future of the
civilian, was regarded as an intrusive alarmist; whilst to
Roberts it appeared, on the other hand, that the sanguine
temperament of the envoy, was likely to be the parent of
a host of evils which might culminate in some frightful
disaster. The controversy had been brought to the notice
of the Governor-General, rather in the shape of private or
demi-official correspondence than in a formal appeal to the
higher authority; and Lord Auckland, who still looked
forward to the entire withdrawal of the regular troops
from Afghanistan, and was, therefore, anxious to support
the functionary on whom would then devolve the chief
military command, ordered an official letter to be written
containing some passages which stung the envoy to the
quick.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Believing, then, that the Governor-General had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
withdrawn his confidence from him, he talked of resigning
his appointment. “If no important operations,” he wrote
to the Private Secretary, “should be contemplated for
next year in this quarter, for the conduct of which it may
be thought desirable that I should remain, some of the
public money will be saved by the appointment of a less-paid
though equally qualified agent. I never yet have
served in an office where I had not the confidence of my
superiors, and my inclination to do so is by no means
strengthened after a laborious public life of thirty-one
years.”</p>

<p>He was sore in spirit at this time because, as he said,
his actions were watched and his measures criticised, and
letters written to Calcutta, setting forth that things were
not going on well in Afghanistan. He complained that
the Governor-General was too willing to listen to all the
stories which reached him from uncertain sources of information,
and he looked upon Lord Auckland’s reasonable
credulity as unreasonable want of confidence in him. “I
am much obliged to you,” he wrote to a friend in August,
“for the kind hint contained in your last. I should never
for a moment think of resigning my post from any difference
of opinion between myself and my superiors, as to
the measures which should be adopted for the security of
our interests in this quarter; but when a want of confidence
is shown in myself personally, I would rather not
wait till I get a less equivocal hint to move. Of late, I
find that there has been kept up a system of espionage
on my proceedings, and that the most ready credence has
been afforded to the malevolent tales of every idle fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
about camp, to say nothing of newspaper fabrications,
which are taken for gospel. I cannot well help myself as
to my correspondents, for Colvin evidently writes to me
with the sanction of the Governor-General.”</p>

<p>But above all these petty cares and distractions rose
the one dominant thought in Macnaghten’s mind, of the
great and beautiful game that was to be played by the
annexation of Herat and the coercion of the Sikhs; and
still he continued to write to Lord Auckland that there
was nothing else to be done. One letter of many will
suffice to show how this leading idea still overbore everything
in his mind:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“We are now arrived at a crisis which calls for the most serious
consideration. If such a course should suit the convenience of
government, I should say that a vigorous policy now is that which
ought to be pursued. It is, indeed, in my opinion, by such a course
alone that our interests can be secured, and your Lordship’s past
policy justified. By annexing Herat to the crown of Caubul, and
by insisting upon the concession of our rights from the ruler of the
Punjab, your Lordship will at once provide for the consolidation
of Shah Soojah’s power, and show to the world that the attainment
of all the advantages contemplated from the movement across the
Indus, has been hitherto opposed only by the perfidious intrigues
of the two powers professing to be our friends and allies. In addition
to the demands already made upon the Sikhs, they should be
required, I think, to admit unequivocally our right of way across
the Punjab, and in the event of their denying this right, they
should be convinced that we can take it. I confess myself utterly
ignorant of what political objections may exist to this course of
proceeding, or of the military means that may be available; and I
am much staggered at a paper which I have just seen from Captain
Sanders, who talks of its being expedient to take 12,000 men against
Herat. I believe, however, that military authorities seldom underrate
the difficulties to be encountered. This paper will, I believe,
be sent to your Lordship by Sir W. Cotton. I have a proposition
from Captain Bean to recognise the right of Mehrab Khan’s son to
the musnud of Khelat. This I think might be done, if he would come
and pay homage in person to Shah Soojah, as Shah Narwaz can never
be re-instated. But I shall tell Captain Bean to keep the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
open if possible, until I know your Lordship’s views regarding
Herat. If it be intended to send a large force into the country
with a view of reducing Herat, the Khelat affair will afford an excellent
screen to our intentions. I must beg your Lordship most
earnestly, if possible, to relieve the two European and five Native
regiments now in this neighbourhood. They are inefficient and
worn out, and both officers and men are grumbling and discontented.
In the present state of affairs it would be very hazardous
to admit of their return, unless their places were filled by fresh
troops, and a relief would enable us to settle with promptitude the
Bajor affairs, and to place our relations with the Khyburees on a
firmer basis. Then, should Dost Mahomed come in, he will have
to be be sent to India, and in the present state of Sikh feeling, I
doubt if it would be prudent to send him across the Punjab with
only a regiment for his escort. We have a rumour very generally
credited, that Colonel Stoddart has been poisoned by the Ameer of
Bokhara, but I yet hope that it will prove incorrect. On the Ghilzye
affairs alluded to in your Lordship’s letter of the 16th, I have this
day written to Mr. Colvin. In a day or two it is my intention to
send up officially, with my comments, a paper handed to me by Sir
A. Burnes, on the present state and future prospects of this country.
I hope to show that, all things considered, we are in as prosperous
a condition as could have been expected. Sir A. of course wishes
to prove the contrary, since by doing so, when he succeeds me,
his failures would thus find excuse and his success additional
credit. This is all natural enough. I have been exposed to a thousand
interruptions whilst writing this, and beg pardon if I have used
too much freedom.”<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p class="p1">In a letter despatched a few days afterwards to Lord
Auckland, Macnaghten wrote: “I trust the Russians may
not come to Khiva this year, for we have quite enough on
our hands without them. Captain Conolly starts in a
few days. I trust your Lordship will have the goodness
to direct that both he and Captain Abbott be gazetted as
lieutenant-colonels whilst serving in Toorkistan.” There
had gone forth a mission&mdash;and an ill-omened one, to
Bokhara&mdash;there had gone forth two missions to Khiva&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
now one was to be despatched to the intervening state
of Kokund.</p>

<p>Eagerly did Arthur Conolly grasp the idea of this
Kokund mission. He was a man of an earnest, impulsive
nature, running over with the purest feelings of benevolence,
and glowing with the most intense longings after
the civilisation and evangelisation of the human race. He
believed that the great Central-Asian movement was
designed by Providence to break down the huge walls of
Mahomedanism which begirt the shining East, and to
substitute civilisation, liberty, and peace, for barbarism,
slavery, and strife. He was a visionary, but one of the
noblest order; and when he looked out beyond the great
barrier of the Hindoo-Koosh, traversed in imagination the
deserts of Merve, and visited the barbarous Courts of
the Khans of Khiva, Kokund, and Bokhara, he never
doubted for a moment that the mission which he was
about to undertake was one of the highest and holiest
with which a Christian officer could be entrusted. “I
feel very confident,” he wrote to a friend, “about all our
policy in Central Asia; for I think that the designs of our
government there are honest, and that they will work
with a blessing from God, who seems now to be breaking
up all the barriers of the long-closed East, for the introduction
of Christian knowledge and peace. It is deeply
interesting to watch the effects that are being produced
by the exertions of the European powers, some selfish and
contrary; others still selfish, but qualified with peace and
generosity; all made instrumental to good. See the French
in Africa; the English, Austrians, and Russians on the Bosphorus,
forcing the Turks to be European under a shadow
of Mahomedanism, and providing for the peaceful settlement
of the fairest and most sacred countries in the world.”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Ever delighting in adventure, and prone to romance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
he was at this time in a frame of mind which rendered
him peculiarly greedy of excitement. A great sorrow was
weighing heavily upon his heart. He sought relief in
stirring occupation&mdash;in active adventure upon new scenes
of enterprise; and when, for a time, it seemed that the
unwillingness of the Supreme Government to sanction the
mission was not to be overcome, he gave vent to the
liveliest feelings of disappointment: “I was greatly disappointed,”
he wrote to a dear friend on the 30th of May,
“when Lord Auckland’s prohibitory letter arrived; for I
had set my heart upon this nobly stirring employment;
and when the chance of it seemed removed, I felt the
blank that a man must feel who has a heavy grief as the
first thing to fall back upon.”</p>

<p>Conolly and Rawlinson were to have proceeded together
to the camp of General Peroffski. But the Muscovite
expedition to Khiva was brought by cold and want to
a mournful end at Ak-boulak, and there was soon no
Russian camp in Central Asia to which these enterprising
officers could be despatched, if the permission
of Government had been obtained. But Conolly, believing
in his inmost heart that there was a much
grander game to be played in those remote regions than
one suggested by the mere accidental circumstance of
the Russian advance, still clung to his conviction of the
policy of the contemplated Mission, and earnestly enforced
his opinions upon his political chief. Macnaghten listened&mdash;yielded&mdash;and
indulging rather the wishes of his friend
than conforming to the dictates of his own judgment,
recommended the enterprise to the favourable consideration
of the Supreme Government; and acting upon certain
passages in a letter from the Chief Secretary, which might
be construed into an implied permission, of a general
rather than a specific character, ordered Conolly to proceed
to Khiva and Kokund.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>It was with feelings of irrepressible delight, that now,
at the beginning of August, Arthur Conolly found himself
“fairly going” on his enterprising journey to the Courts
of the Trans-Oxian Khans. His heart was in the cause.
He was full of impetuous enthusiasm. He was eager that
the British Government should play “the grand game”
in Central Asia, and declared that a mission so righteous
in its objects must prosper in his hands. His spirits rose,
as he looked into the future; and, full of generous
enthusiasm, he began to make preparations for his journey.
“We are just on the wing,” he wrote to Rawlinson on the
22nd of August, “and I shall make the best of my way
to the two capitals for which I carry credentials. It is a
work which must prosper; and I only wish again that you
were to be of the party to accomplish it; but, as I said
before, you occupy a high and useful station, and can’t be
at two places at once. If the British Government would
only play the grand game;&mdash;help Russia cordially to all
that she has a right to expect&mdash;shake hands with Persia&mdash;get
her all possible amends from the Oosbegs, and
secure her such a frontier as would both keep these man-stealers
and savages in wholesome check, and take away
her pretext for pushing herself and letting herself be
pushed on to the Oxus&mdash;force the Bokhara Ameer to be
just to us, the Afghans, and the other Oosbegs states, and
his own kingdom&mdash;but why go on; you know my, at any
rate in <i>one</i> sense, <i>enlarged</i> views. <i>Inshallah!</i> The expepediency&mdash;nay,
the necessity of them will be seen, and we
shall play the noble part that the first Christian nation of
the world ought to fill.”</p>

<p>There were still, however, causes of delay. An ambassador
from Shah Soojah was to accompany the British
officer. But it was long before the King could select
from the people about his Court one to whom he could
entrust so responsible a duty. At last, after much hesitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
his choice fell upon Allahdad Khan Populzye&mdash;a
little, scrubby-looking, sallow-faced man, with a busy
look and a restless eye, believed to be skilful in political
intrigue, and as little likely to betray his trust as any
man about the Court. He left his family and his money
behind him, and these, as the Shah significantly said, were
the best guarantees for his good conduct.</p>

<p>Everything now was ready. Conolly, early in September,
turned his face towards the Hindoo-Koosh. There was a
mission of another kind then setting towards those dreary
regions. It was not a Mission of Peace. Colonel Dennie,
who had distinguished himself at the head of the Ghuznee
stormers, was about to march, with the 35th Sepoy Regiment,
to reinforce the Bameean detachment, and to take
the command of all the the troops on the northern frontier.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">[June-November: 1840.]</p>

<p class="pch">The last Struggles of Dost Mahomed&mdash;&mdash;The British in the Hindoo-Koosh&mdash;&mdash; The
Ameer’s Family&mdash;&mdash; Occupation of Bajgah&mdash;&mdash; Disaster of Kamurd&mdash;&mdash; Escape
of Dost Mahomed&mdash;&mdash;Feverish State of Caubul&mdash;&mdash; Dennie’s
Brigade&mdash;&mdash; Defeat of the Ameer&mdash;&mdash; Sale in the Kohistan&mdash;&mdash; The
Battle of Purwandurrah&mdash;&mdash; Surrender of Dost Mahomed.</p>

<p><span class="beg">It</span> is time that to these regions of the Hindoo-Koosh
attention should now again be directed. The little force
which had been despatched thither in the autumn of 1839,
and had wintered among the caves of Bameean, was by the
coming in of spring released from its inactivity. It was
not Lord’s policy to be quiet. There was Jubbar Khan
with the family of Dost Mahomed at Khooloom. Already
it has been seen that the reception of these people had
been the subject of correspondence between Lord and
Macnaghten. But Jubbar Khan halted between two
opinions. The winter passed away. The spring passed
away. And still he remained with his brother’s family at
Khooloom. The Wullee, or chief, of that place was still
true to the cause of the Ameer; and he permitted the
Newab to maintain this numerous party by levying the
transit duties of the place.</p>

<p>This was a state of things which, in the opinion of Lord
and Macnaghten, had already lasted long enough. They
were eager to bring the Newab to a decision. So, at the
end of May, or the beginning of June, a party was sent
out under Captain Garbett, ostensibly for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
reconnoitring the passes to the north of our position at
Bameean. But there was, doubtless, another object in
view. It was believed that such a demonstration would
have the effect of quickening the movements of Jubbar
Khan, who had more than once been on the point of starting
for the British post, but, overcome by irresolution, had
struck his tents and returned. Already had some of the
party of refugees left their asylum at Khooloom, and sought
the hospitality of the British. Azim Khan, one of the
Ameer’s sons, had “come in;” and some of the women
and children, too, had passed on towards Caubul. But the
Newab himself still vacillated; and it was believed that
a forward movement of our troops would stimulate him to
come to a decision.</p>

<p>The movement had the desired effect. At all events,
Jubbar Khan set out for Bameean. Nor was this the
only noticeable result of the <i>reconnaissance</i>. Beyond the
valley or glen of Kamurd, which stretches northward
from Syghan across the great mountain-range, lay the
isolated fortress of Bajgah. When our reconnoitring party
came upon this place, to their surprise they found it
deserted. It belonged to one Syud Mahomed, who now
appeared, and declared that he had vacated it for the express
purpose of making a tender of the fort to the British,
as an outpost that might be of great service to them. A
small party of infantry were accordingly placed in the fort,
and the circumstance was immediately reported to Dr.
Lord. Lord grasped at the offer; and in the strongest
terms recommended both to Cotton and Macnaghten the
permanent occupation of the post. His arguments prevailed;
and on the 29th of June the Shah’s 4th Regiment,
under Captain Hay, was sent to garrison this isolated fort.
On the 3rd of July, Jubbar Khan arrived at Bameean with
the remaining members of the Ameer’s family, and a large
party of retainers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>It soon became obvious that the occupation of Bajgah
was a mistake. Sturt, the engineer, who had been sent
up to survey the passes, pronounced upon its unfitness as
a military post. It was plain, too, that the temper of the
surrounding tribes was very different from that of the
population about Bameean. At the latter place the
soldiery and the peasantry were on the best possible terms.
About Bajgah the people looked upon the new comers with
a jealous eye. All the efforts of Captain Hay to establish
a friendly intercourse between himself and the inhabitants
failed. They would not bring in grain; they would not
bring in forage. Soon their hostility began to evince itself
in a more alarming manner. “On the extreme summits
of the northern hills overlooking Bajgah, were frequently
seen groups of horsemen, apparently watching the movements
of the people in the deep glen below.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, at this time Hay, the only officer at
Bajgah, was incapacitated by sickness. So he sent to
Syghan for Lieutenant Golding; and on the 2nd of August
sent out a party of two companies, under Sergeant Douglas,
to escort that officer to Bajgah. They performed their
march without interruption, and at night bivouacked under
the walls of a fort held by one Sula Beg. The chief
received them with an outside show of friendliness; and
then despatched a message to another chief, Baba Beg, of
Ajur, saying, “See! I have the Feringhees in a <i>dieg</i>
(caldron). They are ready to your hand. If you are not
here by noontide to-morrow, I will yield up my fort to
them.”</p>

<p>Morning came. There was no appearance of the party
whom they had been sent to meet; so Douglas was preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to return to Bajgah, when a heavy matchlock fire
was opened on his men, from the fort and the surrounding
orchards; and presently a party of Oosbeg horsemen
appeared in sight, and charged down upon the little band,
who met and repulsed the attack. It was a fine thing
then to see the bold front which Douglas and his men
showed to the enemy, as they made their way, exposed to
a heavy matchlock fire, through the dense orchards and
wilderness of gardens. But many fell on the retreat; and
many more would have fallen, for their ammunition was
well-nigh gone, had not Sturt suddenly appeared with two
more companies of the same sturdy Goorkha Regiment,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
and rescued them from inevitable destruction. The enemy
turned and fled; and Sturt and Douglas returned to
Bajgah.</p>

<p>The evil tidings of this disaster soon reached Caubul.
It was a time of deep anxiety. As this month of August
advanced, the perplexities which distracted the mind of
the envoy, gathered around him more closely and more
tormentingly. A series of small but mortifying failures,
of which this Bajgah affair was one, not without a significance
of their own, kept him in a constant state of
excitability, and left him neither rest of body nor serenity
of mind. On the 12th of August he wrote to Major
Rawlinson, saying, “There has been an awkward business
near Bajgah, owing to the incapacity of the officer in
command of the 4th or Ghoorka Regiment. He has
allowed a company to lose thirty or forty men, killed and
wounded, I think but little of this affair. Lord has
gone off to put things to rights. Macgregor has failed
also in his efforts to set matters to rights in Bajore.
His invincibles have been vanquished, and he has lost a
gun. All these little accidents happening at once are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
enough to disgust one; but, <i>Inshallah!</i> the Company’s
Nusseeb will prove superior to them all.”</p>

<p>A week later, and it had become still more apparent
that, even in the very neighbourhood of the capital, sedition
was weaving plots for the subversion of the authority
of the Shah; and that the Sikhs were intriguing
from a distance for the restoration of Dost Mahomed.
On the 19th of August, the envoy wrote to the same
correspondent, that he had “intercepted a letter which, if
genuine (as he had every reason to believe it to be), implicated
many chiefs in meditated insurrection in favour
of Dost Mahomed.” It distinctly stated too, that Nao
Nahal Singh had promised pecuniary aid in furtherance
of the design. “I am now just going to his Majesty,”
he added, “to consult as to what should be done.” It
was time, indeed, that the King and the envoy should
take counsel together. Dost Mahomed had escaped from
Bokhara.</p>

<p>For a while the fugitive Ameer had tasted the bitterness
of close confinement in the city of Bokhara. His
sons, Afzul Khan and Akbar Khan, shared his captivity.
We know how the Khan of this inhospitable place is
wont to treat his Christian guests. His Mahomedan
visitors, whom he at first received with an outside show
of kindness, were dealt with somewhat more leniently.
But the natural ferocity of the man was not to be kept
down. Dost Mahomed nearly became the victim of a
treacherous murder. Baffled in this attempt on the life
of his prisoners, and not daring openly to slay them, the
Bokhara Ameer kept them for a time under strict <i>surveillance</i>,
forbidding them even to repair to worship in
the mosques. This inhospitable treatment seems to have
called forth a remonstrance from the Shah of Persia, in
consequence of which greater liberty was allowed to the
unfortunate Princes. They made the most of the relaxation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and effected their escape. Many romantic incidents
are told about this flight from Bokhara. The horse, on
which the Ameer fled, fell exhausted by the way-side. So
he transferred himself to a caravan, which he chanced to
overtake, and escaped detection only by dyeing his beard
with ink. The Wullee of Khooloom, with unshaken fidelity,
opened his arms to receive his old ally, and placed
all his resources at his command.</p>

<p>It was not long before the Ameer again found himself
at the head of a considerable force. His family, with the
exception of the two sons who had shared his captivity
in Bokhara, were in the hands of the British. He knew
the danger of his determined course, and when reminded
that his wives and children were in our power, sorrowfully
replied, “I have no family; I have buried my wives
and children.” As the Oosbeg fighting men flocked to
the standards of Dost Mahomed and the Wullee of Khooloom,
the hopes of the former seemed to rise; and his
determination to strike a vigorous blow for the recovery
of his lost empire, gathered strength and consistency.
To have cut up the Bameean detachment, and emerging
from the Hindoo-Koosh, to have appeared on the plains
below flushed with victory, raising the old war-cry in the
name of the Prophet, and profiting by the unpopularity
of Shah Soojah and his supporters, in that part of the
country, would have been a noble achievement&mdash;one which
would have rendered easy his triumphant progress to the
very walls of the capital. He determined to make the
effort; and early in September advanced upon Bameean,
with a force of six or eight thousand men.</p>

<p>The month of September brought with it no mitigation
of the anxieties of the envoy. From the country beyond
the Hindoo-Koosh came exaggerated tidings of the successful
progress of Dost Mahomed. “It is reported to-day,”
wrote Macnaghten on the 3rd, “that all Toorkistan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
is in arms against the Feringhees and the <i>Moofsids</i> (rebels)
here are very hard at work. It is certain that Hybuk
has fallen to the Dost, and it is probable that Codrington
will have to retire on Syghan. I put the best face on
matters, and a slight success which our troops had at
Bajgah over a party of the enemy, furnishes me with the
foundation of a good story.”</p>

<p>But this good story soon became a bad one. On the
30th of August the Oosbegs had attacked Bajgah; and the
Goorkhas under Codrington, aided by Rattray with some
Afghan horse, had driven back the assailants. But it was
plain that this isolated post, in the midst of a hostile
population, was no longer tenable. It was expedient,
therefore, to fall back upon Syghan. So Bajgah was
evacuated. The Goorkhas commenced their retreat; and
then it was pronounced that Syghan could not be held
against a large body of hostile troops. It was determined,
therefore, that they would fall back upon Bameean.
They lost everything upon the retreat. We had
pushed on our outposts to those remote points, only to
abandon them disastrously on the first appearance of the
enemy.</p>

<p>But there was something far worse than this. A regiment
of Afghan infantry had been raised, and Captain
Hopkins commanded it. It was the commencement of
an attempt to establish a national army for the support
of the throne. Its loyalty was now to be put to the
proof, by placing it within the reach of all those sinister
influences which were most likely to undermine it. The
result may be readily anticipated. The atmosphere of
the Hindoo-Koosh, and the contiguity of Dost Mahomed,
were fatal to the fidelity of the corps. The Afghan
soldiers, headed by their commandant, Saleh Mahomed,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
deserted their colours; and a number of them joined the
enemy.</p>

<p>Day after day, the tidings brought to Macnaghten were
more and more distressing. All Afghanistan seemed ripe
for revolt. “We are in a stew here,” he wrote to Rawlinson
on the 6th of September, “perhaps greater than
the occasion warrants; but our situation is far from
comfortable. It is reported that the whole country on
this side the Oxus, is up in favour of the Dost, who, with
the Wullee, is certainly advancing in great strength; so
much so that our troops have been obliged to fall back
upon Bameean, whilst we have a formidable band of conspirators
in the city, and the Kohistan is ripe for revolt.
These matters of course engross my serious attention, and
I have about fifty chits to answer every half-hour.....
We are wretchedly weak, having only three infantry
regiments, including one of the Shah’s. We have been
compelled to send off the 35th to reinforce the garrison at
Bameean, but still we are strong enough, I hope, in a fair
field, to lick all the <i>Moofsids</i> that could be brought against
us.”</p>

<p>Macnaghten’s worst fears were confirmed. Caubul now
seemed to be on the eve of an insurrection. On the 9th,
the Envoy, in preturbation of mind, wrote again to Rawlinson
at Candahar: “The town is in a very feverish state.
Some people are shutting up their shops; others, sending
their families away; and some active measures must be
taken for stopping the panic. We have taken possession of
the gate of the Balla Hissar by a guard from Craigie’s regiment,
and brought the mountain train inside the citadel.
The apparently insignificant fact of Mesdames Trevor and
Marsh having come up to the Balla Hissar from the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
has created a great sensation. We are sending out a
party to watch the Charekar Pass, and Sanders goes with
them; so that between force and conciliation and intrigue
(in which art, I am sorry to tell you, I have now taken
my degree), I hope we shall be more than a match for
the Dost. But I have an anxious time of it, as you may
imagine.”</p>

<p>But in the midst of all these perplexities he thought
still of the “great game”&mdash;of the annexation of Herat
and the subjugation of the Punjab&mdash;and chafed under the
restraints which Lord Auckland had imposed upon him.
“I had a letter,” he wrote, “from Lord Auckland yesterday,
and from that I gather that his Lordship’s intentions
are essentially pacific, both as regards Herat and
the Punjab. Oh! for a Wellesley or a Hastings at this
juncture. By a most ingenious process, he has substituted
the cause for the effect, or rather the effect for the cause.
He says, so long as we are continually agitating the question
of taking possession of Peshawur and Herat, we
cannot expect honest co-operation from the powers owning
those places; thus overlooking, or affecting to overlook,
the fact, that but for the dishonesty of those powers the
question would never have been contemplated by us.
This drivelling is beneath contempt. I shall now send
up the proofs I have obtained (and they are tolerably
strong) of the perfidy of the Sikhs without note or
comment, and leave the rest to Providence. I shall
adopt the same course with regard to the intrigues of Yar
Mahomed.”</p>

<p>Day after day, the clouds gathering over Caubul grew
denser and darker. An open enemy was in the field, and
a false friend&mdash;our ally of the famous Tripartite treaty&mdash;was
insidiously pushing his intrigues up to the very
gates of the Balla Hissar. On the 12th of September,
Macnaghten, weary and dispirited, wrote to the Governor-General,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
saying:&mdash;“I am much fatigued, having been
severely worked the whole day; but I write these few
lines just to apprise your Lordship that affairs in this
quarter have the worst possible appearance. The whole
Kohistan is reported to be ripe for revolt, though possibly
in this there may be some exaggeration; and we hear of
resolutions to rise in other parts of the country. But the
worst news of all is that received from Dr. Lord this
morning, to the effect that an entire company of Captain
Hopkins’s corps has gone off with its arms and accoutrements
to join Dost Mahomed Khan, and it is fully expected
that their example will be followed by the whole
regiment. Dost Mahomed Khan is said to be advancing
with his entire force; but Dr. Lord’s intelligence seems
very defective. I have just had a note from Sir W.
Cotton, in which he observes: ‘I really think the time
has now arrived for you and I to tell Lord Auckland, <i>totidem
verbis</i>, that circumstances have proved incontestably that
there is no Afghan army, and that unless the Bengal
troops are instantly strengthened, we cannot hold the
country.’ I have long since, and strongly and repeatedly,
urged my opinion that another brigade should be sent to
us. I have also pointed out that there is no such thing
as an Afghan army, and I have incessantly urged my
earnest opinion to the effect that our position here would
be most perilous unless a stop were put to Sikh intrigues.
They have now been allowed to go on till the country is
thoroughly convulsed by them. Up to this moment
Syud Mahomed Khan, one of the Barukzye triumvirate,
is carrying into effect his iniquitous designs against his
Majesty’s Government. Caubul is full of Sikh emissaries,
and letters were yesterday intercepted from the Sikh
agent to the address, amongst others, of Nao Nehal Singh,
which clearly shows the <i>animus</i> by which the Sikhs are
actuated towards their allies of the Tripartite treaty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
The Sikh agent acknowledged the letters were his own.
He did not know they had been opened.”</p>

<p>The 18th of September was a memorable day. It was
the turning-point of our fortunes in Afghanistan. On
that day the anxieties of the British minister were at
their height. Never was the aspect of affairs more
threatening&mdash;never was there so little to cheer and encourage
the perplexed political chief. The pale cast of
despondency was over all his thoughts. His physical and
mental energies were alike beginning to fail. “At no
period of my life,” he wrote on that 18th of September,
“do I remember having been so much harassed in body and
mind as during the past month. Nor is my uneasiness
yet much lessened. The Afghans are gunpowder, and the
Dost is a lighted match. Of his whereabouts we are
wonderfully ignorant. I have no hope that he will attack
Bameean, and I have great fear that he will throw himself
into the Kohistan, where, it is said, the whole country will
rise in his favour. But I am weary of conjecture; and we
must make the best preparation we can against every
possible contingency. Not the least of my vexations
arises from our inability to depute Shah-zadah Timour at
the present moment. But his presence in the Kohistan is
indispensably necessary. He sets out this evening attended
by all the chivalry of Caubul.”</p>

<p>But upon that very 18th of September&mdash;perhaps whilst
the British minister, in perturbation and despondency of
mind, was tracing these very lines, and looking, with
painful forebodings of evil, for intelligence from the
Hindoo-Koosh, the detachment of troops, long shut up in
those dreary mountain fastnesses, now re-inforced from
Caubul, were achieving a great and decisive victory over
the forces of Dost Mahomed and the Wullee of Khooloom,
and changing the entire aspect of affairs in those remote
Caucasian regions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 14th, the reinforcements under Brigadier Dennie
had reached Bameean. It was currently reported that,
on that day, Dost Mahomed would attack our position.
Nothing, however, was seen of his army, and contradictory
reports of his movements continued to pour into camp.
From the stories which were circulated at Bameean, and
the contents of the letters divulged by the neighbouring
chiefs, it appeared that the Ameer had not yet fully determined
whether to make a descent upon our detachment,
or to avoid the contest. From Kamurd he wrote to one
chief: “For God’s sake, tell me the news! Will the
Feringhees run or fight?” To the Sirdars of the Afghan
corps that has just before deserted, he wrote that all
Toorkistan had joined him, and that he had 40,000 men
at his call. In all his letters he declared that he had taken
up arms for the honour of his religion, and called upon all
true believers to flock to the holy standard of the Prophet.</p>

<p>Brigadier Dennie’s first measure, upon reaching Bameean,
was to disarm the apostate Afghan corps. He then began
to bethink himself of marching upon Syghan to meet the
advancing troops of the Ameer. But the enemy were then
nearer than he anticipated. On the evening of the 17th,
he obtained intelligence to the effect that some advanced
bodies of cavalry were “entering the valley from the great
defile in our front,” six miles from Bameean; and on the
following morning it was reported that they had attacked
a friendly village which had claims to the protection of our
troops. The Brigadier resolved, therefore, to expel them.
It was believed that they constituted the advanced guard
of the Ameer’s army under his son Afzul Khan. On the
morning of the 18th, a detachment was ordered out to
drive the enemy from the valley. Soon after eight o’clock,
two horse-artillery guns under Lieutenant Murray Mackenzie,
two companies of the 35th Native Infantry, two
companies of the Goorkha corps, and about 400 Afghan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
horse, marched out to meet the enemy. About half an
hour afterwards, Dennie, with two more companies of the
Native Infantry regiment, and two also of the Goorkha
corps, followed in support of the advanced detachment.
Instead of coming merely upon the advance of the enemy,
the Brigadier found an army in his front.</p>

<p>But in spite of the slender force at his command, and
the overwhelming numbers of the enemy, Dennie did not
hesitate for a moment. His men were eager to advance;
and he himself was full of confidence and courage. The
enemy had got possession of a chain of forts reaching to
the mouth of the defile, and were collected in bodies round
the several forts, and upon the hills on either side of the
valley. Mackenzie’s guns began to play upon them. A
little while the Oosbegs stood the fire; but the guns were
nobly served, and the shrapnel practice told with terrific
effect on dense bodies of men who had nothing to give back
in return. The Oosbegs fell back, and, as they retreated,
the guns were pushed forward; and first from one distance,
then from another, opened a destructive fire upon the
wavering disconcerted enemy. The Oosbeg force was soon
broken to pieces; and our cavalry were then let slip in
pursuit. Following the disordered masses for some miles
along the defile, they cut down large numbers of the
enemy, and dispersed them in all directions. Dost Mahomed
and his son are said to have owed their lives to the
fleetness of their horses.</p>

<p>Intelligence of this victory soon reached Caubul, and
was received with the liveliest emotions of joy by the
British Resident. His spirits rose at once. Again he
began to look at the present without alarm, and into the
future without despondency. Never was a victory so much
wanted as in that month of September, and never did one
promise so many good results.</p>

<p>“The Dost had only one weapon,” wrote Macnaghten on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the 21st, to Major Rawlinson, “that was religion, and he
certainly wielded it most skilfully. I think the Oosbegs
will now abandon him. Lord has offered handsome terms
to the Wullee, and should this fail, I am not without hope
that Meer Mahomed Beg will seize the present opportunity
of revenging himself on his old enemy.”</p>

<p>The attempt to detach the Wullee of Khooloom from
his alliance with Dost Mahomed was crowned with complete
success. Doubtless Mackenzie’s guns were the great
suasive power. The battle of Bameean must have shown
the Oosbeg chief the hopelessness of further resistance;
and as Dennie was moving on to Syghan, it was prudent
to come at once to terms. Lieutenant Rattray was sent
forward to arrange a meeting between the Wullee and
Dr. Lord; and on the 28th of September, on the summit
of the Dundun-i-Shikun, the British political agent and the
Oosbeg chief entered into engagements, by which the
latter bound himself not to harbour or assist Dost Mahomed,
or any member of his family. The country to the
south of Syghan was ceded to Shah Soojah; that to the
north of it to the Wullee; and a telescope, which he said
had been promised, and which he was hurt at not having
received before, was given to the latter in completion of the
bargain.</p>

<p>But these favourable results were but local and incidental.
“I am like a wooden spoon,” said Dost Mahomed;
“you may throw me hither and thither, but I shall
not be hurt.” Defeated on the Hindoo-Koosh, he reappeared
in the Kohistan. Disaffection was rife throughout
that part of the Douranee Empire. The chiefs had
begun to feel the evils of the new revenue system, or
rather the manner of its administration, which rendered
the tax-gatherer something more than a name. Supported
by British power, the executive officers of the
Shah no longer stood in awe of the petty chieftains, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
soon began to murmur against the change of government,
and to lay all their grievances at the door of the Feringhees.
Thus irritated and exasperated, they were in a
temper to welcome back the Barukzye Sirdar. More
than one fortress was in the hand of a recusant chief; and
it was apprehended that the presence of Dost Mahomed
would set the whole country in a blaze.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In such a conjuncture it became necessary <i>to do something</i>
in the Kohistan. But it was not easy to determine
what. A blow was to be struck, and the chapter of accidents
was to determine how and in what direction it
should fall. Accordingly, in the last week of September,
a force under Sir Robert Sale was ordered to take the
field. Sir Alexander Burnes accompanied it, and directed
its movements. At the entrance of the Ghorebund Pass
was a fortified village, and a chain of detached forts, belonging
to a hostile chief, who was known to be in league
with the fugitive Ameer. The name of this place was
Tootundurrah. On the 29th of September, Sale invested
the enemy’s position. The resistance was very slight.
The fire of our guns and the advance of the infantry
column soon compelled its evacuation, and the place was
speedily in possession of the British troops. The success
was complete, and would have been cheaply purchased;
but one fell there, who, mourned in anguish of spirit by
the Envoy, was lamented by the whole force. Edward
Conolly, a lieutenant of cavalry, one of three accomplished
and enterprising brothers, who had followed the fortunes
of their distinguished relative, Sir William Macnaghten,
and obtained employment under the British Mission, had
on that very morning joined Sale’s force as a volunteer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
He was acting as aide-de-camp to the General; when, as
the column advanced, he was struck down by a shot from
the enemy’s position. The bullet entered his heart. “My
mind was in too disturbed a state all day yesterday,”
wrote the Envoy on the 1st of October, “to admit of my
writing to you. Poor Edward Conolly (Arthur’s next
brother) has been killed by a dubious hand at a petty
fortress in Kohistan. Never did a nobler or a kinder
spirit inhabit a human frame. Poor fellow! he was shot
through the heart, and I believe he was the only individual
on our side killed during the operations of the
29th, when three forts belonging to the chief rebel in the
country were taken. The whole of the chiefs of the
Kohistan have now taken to flight. This is a result I by
no means anticipated; my wish was to punish some, and
to conciliate others. As it is, I fear that Dost Mahomed
Khan will now be received by them with open arms.
There never was such a set of villains. They came in here,
and bound themselves to serve the Shah under the most
solemn oaths conceivable, and yet they had not returned
to their homes half an hour before they reopened their
correspondence with Dost Mahomed. Their punishment
became indispensable, for they would shortly have had
Dost Mahomed amongst them; and now there is a possibility
of their having imbibed so wholesome a terror of
our arms as to prevent their ever again assuming an
offensive attitude.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Having destroyed the defences of Tootundurrah, Sale
advanced on the 3rd of October to the attack of Joolgah&mdash;another
fortified position held by the Kohistanee rebels.
The walls of this place were too thick to be easily breached,
and too high to be easily escaladed. The guns were light;
the scaling ladders were short; and the enemy on the crest
of the breach offered the most determined resistance. The
storming party, led by Colonel Tronson, of the 13th Light
Infantry, advanced to the attack with a desperate gallantry
worthy of a more distinguished success. Many of the
leading men were shot dead in the breach; the struggle
to effect a lodgment was ineffectual; and the column was
eventually withdrawn. Repulsed, but not disheartened by
failure, the British troops were preparing to renew the
attack, when the enemy, dreading the recommencement
of hostilities, left the fort in the hands of the besiegers.
The works were destroyed; and so far the movement was
successful&mdash;but the failure of the assault deeply mortified
the Envoy. “I have bad news to send you,” he wrote on
the 4th of October; “our arms have met with a reverse
at Joolgah in the Kohistan.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> A storm and escalade was
attempted, but it would not do. The enemy evacuated
the place in the evening; but I fear that the whole of the
Moofsids (rebels) have escaped...... Burnes represents
the country as being in a very unsettled state; and I fear
that it will be necessary for his Majesty to remain in
Caubul this winter. I intend to write and tell Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Auckland that he must send us reinforcements <i>viâ</i> the
Punjab. The Dost was last heard of at Kanjau; but I
have no doubt of his soon entering Nijrow. Would it be
justifiable to set a price on this fellow’s head? We have
intercepted several letters from him, from all of which it
appears that he meditates fighting with us so long as the
breath is in his body.”</p>

<p>During that month of October, to the annoyance and
embarrassment of the political officers and the discomfort
of the troops, Dost Mahomed was flitting about from place
to place, with no intelligible plan of action to give it
any shape and consistency to our counter-operations.
Various were the reports which reached the British camp;
various the accounts of the nature of his movements and
the number of his adherents. Many of these were of the
most conflicting character;&mdash;and the best-informed officers
in the British camp were beset with doubt and perplexity.
On the 11th of October it was known that the Ameer was
in the valley of Ghorebund. “I believe that there can be
little or no doubt,” wrote Macnaghten to Lord Auckland,
on the following day, “of Dost Mahomed’s having entered
Ghorebund, and of his being at this moment within forty
or fifty miles distance from Caubul. It is impossible to
say what may be the effect of his coming into this neighbourhood.
But I apprehend very serious consequences,
for both the town of Caubul and the country are ripe for
revolt. Dr. Lord writes that, as soon as Dost Mahomed
heard of Mr. Rattray’s approach, he said he would not
remain to be sold to the Feringhees, and immediately took
the road to Ghorebund. I cannot ascertain how many
men he has with him&mdash;some accounts say ten thousand,
others, three hundred. The last is, I dare say, nearer
the mark&mdash;but what I dread is, the effect of his incessant
intrigues (whilst he is so near us) upon the minds of the
population.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Such, indeed, at this time, were the gloomy forebodings
which overshadowed the minds of the political chiefs, that
they predicted the necessity of concentrating the troops in
the Balla Hissar of Caubul, and actually began to talk of
making preparations for a siege. Guns were mounted on
the citadel to overawe the town. The guards were everywhere
increased. The Bameean detachment was ordered
to return to the capital with all possible despatch. And
Macnaghten began to talk about “submitting to the
disgrace of being shut up in Caubul for a time.” It was,
indeed, a critical moment. It has been seen that the
Envoy had begun to contemplate the expediency of setting
a price on the Ameer’s head. It is a proof alike of the
dangers that beset our position in Afghanistan, and the
disturbing effects they had wrought upon the minds of our
political ministers, that such was the exasperation produced
by the apparent success of Dost Mahomed, even upon the
kindly nature of the Envoy, that he talked about “showing
no mercy to the man who was the author of all the evil
now distracting the country.” Shah Soojah had long been
eager to “hang the dog;” and now, in conversation with
Macnaghten, he taunted him with his mistaken leniency.
“I suppose you would, even now,” said the King, “if I
were to catch the dog, prevent me from hanging him.”
“It will be time enough,” said the Envoy, “to talk about
that when your Majesty has caught him.” The British
minister was about to take his leave, when the Shah
arrested him, and said: “You know I have from the first
expressed to you a mean opinion of my own countrymen.
If you want further proofs, look at <i>that</i> from my own
brother.” He then placed in the Envoy’s hands an intercepted
letter to the address of the Barukzye chief, Sultan
Mahomed, proposing that, with his aid, and that of the
Sikhs, Shah Zemaun should be placed on the throne, as
Shah Soojah had made over the country to the dominion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of infidels. The letter bore the seal of the old blind king
himself. It was on the following day that the Envoy wrote
to the Governor-General that no mercy should be shown to
the Ameer; but he added, “should he be so fortunate as
to secure the person of Dost Mahomed, I shall request his
Majesty not to execute him till I can ascertain your Lordship’s
sentiments.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>In the mean while, the force under Sir Robert Sale had
moved, in pursuit of the Ameer, into the Nijrow country.
On the 18th they were encamped near Kardurrah; and on
the 20th were meditating an attack on the place. The
Envoy, who watched their proceedings with extreme
anxiety, was impatient of the seeming dilatoriness of their
movements; and wrote to one of his colleagues: “Burnes
and Sale, with nearly 2000 good infantry, are sitting down
before a fortified position about twenty miles distant, and
are afraid to attack it. The enemy made an attack upon
them the night before last&mdash;killed and wounded some of
our people, and got off unscathed. All this is very bad.”
But it was not in reality so bad as it seemed to the perplexed
and anxious minister at Caubul. Whilst he was
writing, preparations were in progress for an attack, on
the following day. On the morning of the 21st the force
was ready and eager for action. But as the troops
advanced, fresh and in good spirits, upon Kardurrah, a
party of villagers met them with tidings to the effect that
the enemy had abandoned their position, and that the
place was without an inhabitant. If any feelings of
mortification welled up on the discovery that the garrison
had escaped our toils, they very quickly subsided. It was
plain that the enemy had made a great mistake, and that
the British force had providentially been delivered from a
great danger. The position that the “rebels” had abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
was one of uncommon strength, and, had it been
defended with any spirit, could only have been carried, if
at all, after a large expenditure of life.</p>

<p>Dost Mahomed was now in the Nijrow country. His
cause seemed to gather strength. Even some of Shah
Soojah’s soldiers deserted their British officers and flocked
to the Ameer’s standard. On the 27th of October he
broke ground, and moved down towards the capital. On
the 29th, intelligence of his movements having reached
the British camp at Bhag-alum, the force marched out
to intercept the enemy. The two following days were
employed by the engineer officers in reconnoitring and
surveying the surrounding country; and on the 1st of
November the force encamped before Meer-Musjedee’s fort.
Here it was ascertained that they were in the neighbourhood
of the enemy, and preparations were made to give
battle to the Ameer and his adherents.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of November&mdash;a day which has obtained
a melancholy celebrity in the annals of the English in
Afghanistan&mdash;the British force came at last in sight of
the enemy. The army of the Ameer was posted in the
valley of Purwandurrah. The Nijrow hills were bristling
with the armed population of a hostile country. Unprepared
for the conflict, Dost Mahomed had no design, on
that November morning, of giving battle to the Feringhees.
An unexpected movement precipitated the collision. On
the first appearance of the British troops the Ameer
evacuated the village of Purwandurrah and the neighbouring
forts; and was moving off to a position on some elevated
ground commanded by a steep hill to the rearward, when,
at the suggestion of Dr. Lord, the British cavalry were
moved forward to outflank the Afghan horse.</p>

<p>It was a clear bright morning. The yellow foliage of
autumn glittered like gold in the broad sunlight. The
opposite hills were alive with the enemy. The crisp fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
air, so bracing and invigorating to the human frame, seemed
to breathe confidence and courage. Dost Mahomed, who,
since his defeat at Bameean, had been often heard of, but
never seen, by the British troops, and who seemed to elude
the grasp of the Army of Occupation like an <i>ignis fatuus</i>,
was now actually within their reach. It ought to have
been an hour of triumph. It was one of humiliation.
The Afghans were on the hills skirting one side of the
pass; the British troops were on the opposite declivity.
Dost Mahomed saw our cavalry advancing, and from that
moment cast behind him all thought of retreat. At the
head of a small band of horsemen, strong, sturdy Afghans,
but badly mounted, he prepared to meet his assailants.
Beside him rode the bearer of the blue standard which
marked his place in the battle. He pointed to it; reined
in his horse; then snatching the white <i>lunghi</i> from his
head, stood up in his stirrups uncovered before his followers,
and called upon them, in the name of God and the Prophet,
to drive the cursed Kaffirs from the country of the faithful.
“Follow me,” he cried aloud, “or I am a lost man.”
Slowly, but steadily, the Afghan horsemen advanced.
The English officers, who led our cavalry to the attack,
covered themselves with glory. The native troopers fled
like sheep. Emboldened by the craven conduct of the
British cavalry, the Afghan horsemen rode forward, driving
their enemy before them, and charging right up to the
position of the British, until almost within reach of our
guns.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The Afghan sabres told, with cruel effect, upon
our mounted men. Lieutenants Broadfoot and Crispin
were cut to pieces. A treacherous shot from a neighbouring
bastion brought Dr. Lord to the ground; and the
dagger of the assassin completed the work of death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Captains Fraser and Ponsonby, whose gallantry has never
been surpassed even in the annals of old Roman heroism,
still live to show their honourable scars; and to tell,
with mingled pride and humiliation, the story of that
melancholy day.</p>

<p>In front of our columns, flaunting the national standard,
the Afghans stood for some time masters of the field, and
then quietly withdrew from the scene of battle. Sir
Alexander Burnes, awed by this disaster, wrote to Sir William
Macnaghten that there was nothing left for the force
but to fall back upon Caubul, and implored the Envoy
there to concentrate all our troops. Sir William received
the letter on the 3rd of November, as he was taking his
evening ride in the outskirts of the city. His worst forebodings
seemed to be confirmed. Little did he know what
thoughts were stirring in the breast of the Ameer. Dost
Mahomed, in the very hour of victory, felt that it was
hopeless to contend against the power of the British
Government. He had too much sagacity not to know that
his success at Purwandurrah must eventually tend, by
moving the British to redouble their exertions, rather to
hasten than to retard the inevitable day of his final
destruction. He quitted the field in no mood of exultation;
with no bright visions of the future before him. He
had won the last throw, but the final issue had ceased to
be a matter of speculation. The hour in which, with
dignity and grace, he might throw himself upon the protection
of his enemies, now seemed to have arrived. He
had met the British troops in the field, and, at the head
of a little band of horsemen, had driven back the cavalry
of the Feringhees. His last charge had been a noble one;
he might now retire from the contest without a blot upon
his name.</p>

<p>So thought the Ameer; as was his wont, taking counsel
of his saddle. None knew in the British camp the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
he had taken; none guessed the character of his
thoughts. On the day after the victory of Purwandurrah
he was under the walls of Caubul. He had been four-and-twenty
hours in the saddle; but betrayed little symptoms
of fatigue. A single horseman attended him. As they
approached the residence of the British Envoy, they saw
an English gentleman returning from his evening ride.
The attendant galloped forward to satisfy himself of the
identity of the rider, and being assured that the Envoy was
before him, said that the Ameer was at hand. “What
Ameer?” asked Macnaghten. “Dost Mahomed Khan,”
was the answer; and presently the chief himself rode up
to the British minister. Throwing himself from his horse,
Dost Mahomed saluted the Envoy, said he was come to
claim his protection, and placed his sword in Macnaghten’s
hand. But the Envoy returning it to him, desired the
Ameer to remount. They then rode together into the
Mission compound&mdash;&mdash; Dost Mahomed asking many eager
questions about his family as they went. A tent having
been pitched for his accommodation, he wrote letters to
his sons, exhorting them to follow his example and seek
the protection of the British Government.</p>

<p>He seemed to have become reconciled to his fate. He
had no wish, he said, to escape. Force, indeed, would not
drive him to abandon the refuge he had voluntarily sought.
With Macnaghten he conversed freely of his past history;
and raised, by the recital alike of his doings and his sufferings,
the strongest feelings of admiration and compassion
in the Envoy’s breast. Every effort was made to soothe
the Ameer’s feelings; and he soon became serene and
cheerful. A report that it was the design of our government
to banish him to London, disturbed his equanimity
for a time; but he was soon reassured by the promises of
the Envoy, and began to look forward with hopefulness to
a life of repose and security in the Company’s dominions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
A few days after his surrender, his eldest son, Afzul Khan,
came into the British camp.</p>

<p>A prisoner, but an honoured one, Dost Mahomed
remained some ten days at Caubul, during which time all
the leading officers of the garrison paid him the most
marked attention. Men, who kept aloof from Shah Soojah,
as one to be religiously avoided, were eager to present
themselves before the unfortunate Ameer, and to show
that they respected him in his fallen fortunes. He received
his visitors with courtesy, and conversed with them with
freedom. Seated on the ground, he desired them to be
seated; and seemed to take pleasure in the society of the
brave men who did him honour. Captain Nicolson, an
officer of distinguished gallantry and great intelligence,
whose early death on the banks of the Sutlej is to be
deeply deplored, having been selected by Sir W. Macnaghten
to fill the difficult and delicate office of custodian to the
fallen prince, acted, on these occasions, as interpreter.
It may be doubted whether a single officer quitted his
presence without drawing a comparison between the
Ameer and the Shah, very much to the disadvantage of
the latter. The King refused to see his prisoner, alleging
that he would not be able to bring himself to show common
civility to such a villain. “This is well,” said the Envoy,
writing to the Private Secretary of the Governor-General,
“as the Dost must have suffered much humiliation in being
subjected to such an ordeal.” All the natural kindliness of
the Envoy now set in towards the fallen prince, and all the
courtesies of the English gentleman were freely bestowed
upon him.</p>

<p>On the 12th of November, 1840, Dost Mahomed Khan,
under a strong escort,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> commenced his journey towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the provinces of India; and two months afterwards Macnaghten
wrote:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I trust that the Dost will be treated with liberality. His case
has been compared to that of Shah Soojah; and I have seen it
argued that he should not be treated more handsomely than
his Majesty was; but surely the cases are not parallel. The
Shah had no claim upon us. We had no hand in depriving him
of his kingdom, whereas we ejected the Dost, who never offended
us, in support of our policy, of which he was the victim.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p class="p1">And so Macnaghten, in a few lines of irrepressible truth
and candour, denounced the injustice of the policy of which
he himself had been one of the originators. It is possible,
too, that Lord Auckland may have felt that Dost Mahomed
“never offended us,” but that we had victimised
him; for he received the Prince he had deposed with becoming
hospitality and respect, and burdened the revenues
of India with a pension in his favour of two lakhs of rupees.</p>

<p><span class="beg">The</span> remainder of the month of November passed away
in peace and tranquillity. The Envoy began now for the
first time to taste the blessings of repose, and to enjoy the
advantages of leisure. But his active mind was soon again
busily at work. Dost Mahomed had surrendered; but the
Sikhs had not been coerced. The time for the “macadamisation”
of the Punjab seemed now to have arrived. To
the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces
of India, he wrote on the 24th of November, of the “piping
times of peace, so unfavourable to the exercise of the
epistolary art,” and of the “cards which played so beautifully
into his hands.” “This is the time,” he added, “for a
subsidiary force in the Punjab, and for the cession of the
districts to the west of the Indus. We are clearly not
bound any longer by the Tripartite treaty, and so I have
told Lord Auckland; but I don’t think his Lordship’s
ambition will aim at more than keeping matters on their
present footing. We start for Jellalabad in three or four
days; and it is high time we should do so, as the weather
is becoming bitterly cold here. We shall now have a little
time to devote to the affairs of the country, and I trust its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
condition will be soon as flourishing as its poor resources
will admit.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Before the end of November, the Court were on their
way to their winter quarters at Jellalabad. On the morning
of the 13th they reached that place. The Envoy
found Sir Willoughby Cotton still there, but “anxious to
get away;” and Captain Macgregor, the political agent in
charge of the district, surrounded by a motley crew of the
chiefs of the country, who seemed to look up to him as
their common father. In the enjoyment of a little rest
from pressing anxieties, the Envoy began to turn his
thoughts to the domestic administration of the country.
“We have hitherto,” he wrote to the Private Secretary of
the Governor-General, “been struggling for existence,
without any leisure to turn to the improvement of the
administration.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> And very little of this leisure was even
now vouchsafed to him. Though Dost Mahomed was on
his way to the provinces of India, and the winter snows
had now set in, the struggle for existence was still going
on, and more fiercely than ever. The Ghilzyes and Kohistanees
had already risen up against the government of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Shah and his supporters; and now the Douranees were
breaking out into revolt.</p>

<p>It has been shown, that on the reappearance of Shah
Soojah at Candahar, the Douranees, enfeebled and prostrated
by their Barukzye oppressors, clustered around the
throne, and sought from the restored monarch the privileges
and immunities which had been wrested from them
by the Sirdars. Uncertain, at that time, of the ultimate
success of the expedition, and eager to swell the number
of his adherents, the Shah was willing to grant, and more
willing still to promise. He made certain remissions of
taxation in favour of the tribes; but he entrusted the
execution of these new popular measures to the old
unpopular agency; and the Parsewan revenue-collectors,
who had oppressed the tribes during the reign of the
Sirdars, were still left to exercise their hated calling under
the King.</p>

<p>The experiment of giving is a dangerous one. In the
ordinary concerns of human life, it is found that the shortcomings
of those who give bring down upon them more
hatred and more reproach than the withholdings of those
who give not. It is perilous to raise hopes not to be fulfilled.
The Douranees had looked for much from the
restoration of the Shah; and they were disappointed.
They had patiently submitted to the exactions and oppressions
of the Barukzyes&mdash;but the imperfect liberality of the
Suddoyze monarch irritated them past endurance. They
looked upon the Barukzyes as their natural enemies, and
they submitted when they knew that they had no power
of resistance. But believing that it was the wish of the
restored government of the Shah to conciliate and encourage
them, they demonstrated their dissatisfaction in a
violent and offensive manner, with the strongest assurance
in their mind that their grievances would be redressed.
Under the Barukzyes such a course would have been worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
than useless, for their spasms of painful unrest were pleasing
to the Sirdars. But as it seemed that the Shah desired
to please them, they strove to evince, by most unmistakeable
signs, that they were not pleased; and broke out
into rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>In Zemindawer, a district which lies to the north-west of
Candahar, symptoms of inquietude began to evince themselves
at the end of 1840. At this time, the affairs of
Candahar and its neighbourhood were, as regards all
European superintendence, under the charge of Major
Rawlinson. This officer, who had been employed for some
years in Persia,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and on the rupture of our friendly
relations with that state, necessarily remanded to India,
had been so strongly recommended, for his intimate
acquaintance with the languages, the people, and the
politics of the East, as well as for his general aptitude and
intelligence, by Sir John M‘Niell to Lord Auckland, that
the Governor-General ordered him to proceed to Caubul, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
be employed under Macnaghten. In the early part of 1840
it had been proposed to despatch Rawlinson and Arthur
Conolly on a mission to the camp of the Russian General
Peroffski, but the breaking up of the Khivan expedition
caused this project to be abandoned; and another field of
activity was opened out to Rawlinson in a region less
inhospitable and remote. The supervision of affairs at
Candahar had hitherto been entrusted to Major Leech;
but Leech had given offence to the Envoy by the dilatoriness
with which he had sent in his accounts, and it had
seemed good to Macnaghten to remove him from his post.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
He could not have appointed a better man than Rawlinson
to fill it. So, on the 4th of July, he sent to that officer the
Shah’s official notification of his appointment as political
agent at Candahar.</p>

<p>The command of the troops at Candahar was in the
hands of Major-General Nott. He was an old Sepoy officer
of good repute; a man of some talents, but blunt address&mdash;an
honest, plain-spoken soldier, not always right, but
always believing himself to be right&mdash;hearty, genuine, and
sincere. His faults were chiefly those of temper. He had
not been well used. Sir Henry Fane had recognised his
merits; but Sir John Keane, who was accused of fostering
a narrow-minded prejudice against the Company’s service,
had superseded him in a manner which had greatly
incensed the General himself, and the army to which he
belonged.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Labouring under a strong sense of the injustice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
that had been done him; feeling that his worth had
not been duly appreciated, or his services duly rewarded;
seeing much in the general management of the affairs of the
distracted country in which his lot had been cast to excite
his unqualified disapprobation; and being, moreover,
constitutionally of an irritable temperament, he sometimes
said and wrote what was calculated to offend others; and
as the political officers were the especial objects of his
dislike, he was in no favour at the Residency. Macnaghten
declared that the general’s conduct frequently embarrassed
him, and recommended, therefore, his recall. But it was felt
that Nott was a fine soldier; and, though the Government
eventually listened to the Envoy’s counsel in this matter,
they were slow to remove him from a sphere in which his
energy and decision were likely to be so serviceable to the
state. And, perhaps, it was felt that, in his political
colleague at Candahar, Nott had a man of excellent
temper, of great tact and forbearance, and that the difficulty
was much lessened by so fortunate an association.</p>

<p>Such were the men upon whom, at the beginning of
1841, devolved the duty of looking this Douranee outbreak
fairly in the face. The task that fell to Nott’s share was
the easier of the two. He had simply to beat the enemy
in the field. The insurgents of Zemindawer had risen up
against a party of the Shah’s horse, who had been sent out
to support the revenue officers, and had defeated and
dispersed them. A detachment, therefore, was ordered
out against them, under Captain Farrington. On the
morning of the 3rd of January they came up with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
rebels. The Douranee horse, some 1200 or 1500 strong,
showed a bold front; but the fire of Hawkins’s guns was
too hot for them, and they began to waver. The infantry
well completed what the cavalry had well begun; the
insurgents were driven from their position, and were soon
broken and dispersed. And so, for the time, the military
officer had done his work, and with good success. The
political officer had a more difficult duty to perform.
Rawlinson was called upon to elucidate the causes of the
dissatisfaction of the Douranees, and to recommend the
best means of quenching the dangerous spirit of revolt.
The causes, doubtless, were numerous, and there were some
which lay far beneath the surface. Both in private letters
to Macnaghten and in a masterly official report, to which
allusion has been made, Rawlinson probed them to their
very depths&mdash;but his views were not in accordance with
those of the Envoy, and his warnings were disregarded.</p>

<p>Macnaghten had at first been willing to believe that
this revolt of the Douranees had risen out of the tyrannical
interference of unpopular revenue-administrators, which
had left them in a mood of mind favourable in the extreme
to the designs of any discontented or factious chief who
had objects to gain, or resentments to gratify, by stirring
the country into rebellion. “Aktur Khan,” he wrote to
Mr. Colvin, “was disappointed in not getting the chiefship
of Zemindawer; and he found the people in a temper to
aid his rebellious projects, owing to the oppressions practised
by the Wakeel.” But he was slow to believe that
there was any general feeling of disaffection in the country;
that the double government we had established was
essentially and necessarily unpopular; or that such occasional
outbreaks as he was condemned to witness were the
results of anything more than personal and accidental
circumstances, from which no general conclusions were to
be drawn. He never believed that there was any nationality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
among the Afghans, or that the presence of the
stranger and the Infidel in their land could be a sore
continually to fester and to throb.</p>

<p>Still less did he believe it possible that our presence in
Afghanistan could be hateful to the King himself, who
owed everything to us. But it was reported, and believed
by many in the neighbourhood of Candahar, that Shah
Soojah had secretly fomented the rebellion of the Douranees.
The Shah shook with rage, when this story was
told him, and vowed that the man, to whom its authorship
had been traced, should pay the penalty of his mendacity
by having his tongue cut out at the root. “And I really
think,” said Macnaghten, “there would be no harm in
depriving the rascal of his ears.” But there were others
who believed then and afterwards, that the old king was
as eager as any one of his subjects, to see the white-faced
intruders swept from the face of the land; and that he
yearned to be in deed, as well as in name, supreme in the
Douranee Empire.</p>

<p>To have acknowledged either the unpopularity of our
occupation of Afghanistan, or the faithlessness of the King,
would have been to have acknowledged the entire failure
of our policy. So Macnaghten still continued to seek for
accidental causes of the popular discontent, and to talk of
superficial remedies. “My own impression is,” he wrote
to Mr. Colvin, on the 5th of February, “that matters will
revert to a wholesome state as soon as ever the incubus of
apprehension is removed from the body of the people; and
this will be effected by the simple recall of the obnoxious
Parsewan managers.” But there was another source to
which, at this time, he was fain to attribute the inquietude
of Western Afghanistan. He suspected, and not without
reason, that the disaffection of the Douranees had been
fomented by the intrigues of Yar Mahomed. The suspicion
soon rose into knowledge. There were undeniable proofs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
that the Heratee Wuzeer had been writing inflammatory
letters to the Douranee chiefs. He had sent a delegate,
named Nussur-ood-deen Khan, into the Zemindawer
country, with letters to each of the principal Douranee
chiefs, and one of them had forwarded to Lieutenant
Elliot, Rawlinson’s assistant, a copy of the seditious missive,
which ran to the following effect:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">Let each of you assemble his followers, and go in to Aktur Khan
in Zemindawer, and be ready and prepared, for I have moved out
of Herat; and from Meshed, troops 10,000 strong, with twelve guns
and two lakhs of rupees, are marching to our assistance. At latest,
I shall arrive at Bukhwa by the end of the month Mohurram. Let
not any Douranee chief of those now assembled disperse his followers,
for I am most assured of coming to join you.</p>

<p class="p1">The fact was not to be doubted; but it was in no way
the cause of the disorder. It merely aggravated the
external symptoms of a deeply-seated disease. Vexatious
and embarrassing as was this intelligence, there was worse
behind to astound the Envoy, and make him cry out more
and more bitterly against the authorities, who had thwarted
his long cherished desire to play the “great game.” Suddenly
there came upon him tidings that the outrages and
the exactions&mdash;the treachery and the insolence&mdash;of Yar
Mahomed had reached such a pitch, that Todd had broken
up the British Mission, and set his face towards Candahar.</p>

<p>The Wuzeer had long been accommodating his demands
to every change in the political barometer. Unfortunately,
those changes had indicated little but the depressed circumstances
of our position in Afghanistan. The disaster
of Major Clibborne; the fall of Khelat; and the progress
of Dost Mahomed on the Hindoo-Koosh, were adverse
circumstances which encouraged the Wuzeer to rise in his
demands for more money, and even to meditate aggressive
movements of a more palpable character than any which
had yet been undertaken against the power of Shah Soojah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and his supporters. At one time he contemplated an
attack upon Candahar, and was anxious that his intentions
should be known to the British Mission. The surrender
of Dost Mahomed had, however, somewhat checked his
presumption; and the descent upon Candahar was postponed.</p>

<p>The knowledge of the Zemindawer outbreak soon caused
the project to be revived. Having despatched an emissary
to the disaffected country to keep alive the spirit of
revolt, Yar Mahomed at the same time sent, secretly and
suddenly, a deputation to the Persian governor at Meshed,
seeking pecuniary assistance from his government, promising
to expel the British mission from Herat, and
urging him to unite in an attack on Candahar, whilst the
communications between that place and Caubul were cut
off by the snow.</p>

<p>This last glaring act of perfidy excited Todd to retaliate.
He believed that there was a point of forbearance beyond
which it would be disgraceful to his country to descend;
so he determined to suspend the payment of the allowance<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
which had been granted to the state; and, taking
advantage of the presence of a large body of troops in
Upper Sindh, announced, on the 1st of February, his
intention to the Wuzeer. But Yar Mahomed, at this
time, was intent on playing a “great game.” He believed
that his deputation had been favourably received at
Meshed; he believed that the Douranees were again
working themselves into rebellion; and he had abundant
faith in the continued forbearance of the British government.
So he played, with his accustomed craft, for a
large stake; and little heeded the consequences of failure.
The one object of all his intrigues was to obtain money&mdash;money
for the state&mdash;money for himself. On the 8th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
February he came forward with a string of specific
demands. He asked for two lakhs of rupees to pay his
own debts; he asked for an increased monthly allowance
to his Government, to be guaranteed for a year; he asked
for further improvement of the fortifications of Herat at
the expense of the British Government; he asked for
loans of money to enable Herat to recover possession of
its lost territories, the troops to be subsisted in the field
at our expense; and he asked for a written agreement to
relieve him “from all apprehension for the future.” He
knew well what he merited at our hands, and years afterwards
justified his conduct to the British Mission, on the
ground that he dreaded the influence of our officers, and
felt that his very existence was at stake.</p>

<p>To these extravagant demands Todd gave an answer
regulated by his knowledge of the forbearing course, which
his Government desired him to pursue. He told the
Wuzeer that before he could comply, even in a modified
form, with such requests, he should require some guarantee
that such concessions would not be thrown away. Yar
Mahomed had some time before declared his willingness to
admit a British garrison into Herat. If this were now
done, some of his demands might be granted. Yar Mahomed
clutched at this; but turning the proposed garrison
into a British force to be located in the valley of
Herat, declared that, on the payment of two lakhs of
rupees, he would give his assent to the measure. Never
had he the shadow of an intention of fulfilling his part of
the contract&mdash;but he wanted the money. His sincerity
was soon tested. Todd demanded that the Wuzeer’s son
should be sent to Ghiresk, there to await an answer from
the Government of India, and to escort, if the measure
were approved, the British troops to Herat; and it was
added, that on the Sirdar’s arrival at that place the money
demanded would be paid. But Yar Mahomed at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
refused his assent to Todd’s proposal. He required the
immediate payment of the money or the departure of the
Mission. So the British agent chose the latter alternative,
and turned his back upon Herat.</p>

<p>Never before, perhaps, had the British Government
been so insulted and so outraged in the person of its
representatives. Shah Kamran, at a private audience,
told one of the officers of the Mission that, but for his
protection, “not a Feringhee would have been left alive;”
and asked if he did not deserve some credit for not acting
towards Todd and his companions as the Ameer of Bokhara
had acted towards Colonel Stoddart. Yar Mahomed had
intercepted Todd’s letters to Candahar. He had been for
some time in an habitual state of intoxication. The
seizure of the persons of the British officers, and the
plunder of their property, had been openly discussed by
the Wuzeer and his profligate friends, and there is little
doubt that, if the Mission had remained longer at Herat,
the members of it would have been subjected to indignities
of the worst kind.</p>

<p>The Mission left Herat, and halted for a time at Ghiresk.
When the tidings of its abrupt departure reached Lord
Auckland at Calcutta, he was roused into a state of very
unwonted exacerbation. He was not a hasty man&mdash;he
was not an unjust one. But on this occasion he committed
an act both hasty and unjust. He at once repudiated
the proceedings of Major Todd at Herat; and
removed him from political employment.</p>

<p>“I am writhing in anger and in bitterness,” he wrote
to the Lieutenant-Governor of Agra, “at Major Todd’s
conduct at Herat, and have seen no course open to me,
in regard to it, but that of discarding and disavowing
him; and we have directed his dismissal to the provinces.
What we have wanted in Afghanistan has been repose
under an exhibition of strength, and he has wantonly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
against all orders, done that which is most likely to produce
general disquiet, and which may make our strength
inadequate to the calls upon it. I look upon a march to
Herat as perfectly impracticable; and if it were not so, I
should look upon it, under present circumstances, as most
inexpedient. We have taught Yar Mahomed to be more
afraid of us than of the Persians. It is possible that,
when he has been left a little time to himself, he will be
more afraid of the Persians than of us&mdash;but, in the mean
time, the state to which things have been brought is a
cause of much anxiety and more apprehension to me.”</p>

<p>That, in one sense, the Heratee Mission failed, is certain;
but, there were some of Todd’s measures which did
not fail, and it is not to be forgotten that on his own
responsibility he despatched Abbott and Shakespear to
Khiva, and the good that was done by these Missions was
often in the retrospect a solace to him in after days, when
smarting under the injustice of his masters.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Substantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
benefits, too, were conferred on the people of Herat&mdash;benefits
still remembered with gratitude, and seldom
spoken of without some expression of respect and admiration
for their benefactors. The unceasing charities and
the blameless lives of the officers of the Mission raised
the character of the British nation as it was raised in no
other part of Afghanistan. But Lord Auckland never
forgave the diplomatic failure. Todd’s departure from
Herat was inopportune; for, although he had no reason
to believe the settlement of our differences with Persia
was any nearer to its consummation than it had been for
some time, they were then on the eve of adjustment.
Had he known this, he would have braved everything and
remained at Herat, encouraged by the thought that the
re-establishment of our amicable relations with Persia
would effectually cripple the power and restrain the
audacity of the Heratee minister. Remanded to his
regiment, Todd proceeded to join it at the head-quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of the Artillery at Dum-Dum. “Equal to either fortune,”
he fell back upon the common routine of regimental
service, and, in command of a company of Foot
Artillery, devoted himself with as much earnest and
assiduous zeal to the minutiæ of military duty, as he had
done, a year before, to the affairs of the Herat Mission.
It has often been said that political employ unfits a man
for regimental duty; but Major Todd, from the time that
he first rejoined his regiment to the hour of his death,
never slackened in his attention to his military duties;
and, perhaps, in the whole range of the service, there was
not a more zealous, a more assiduous&mdash;in other words, a
more conscientious regimental officer than the old antagonist
of Yar Mahomed. The trait of character here
illustrated is a rarer one than may be supposed. Nothing
in his political life became him like the leaving of it.
There are few who know how, gracefully, to <i>descend</i>.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that these years of regimental
duty were the happiest period of his life. Shortly after
his return to the Presidency, from which he had so long
been absent, he married; and in the enjoyment of
domestic happiness, such as has rarely been surpassed,
he soon forgot the injustice that had been done to him.
Cheerfully doing his duty in that state of life to which
it had pleased God to call him, respected and beloved by all
who had the means of appreciating the simplicity of his
manners, the kindness of his heart, the soundness of his
intelligence, and the integrity of his conduct, he found
that, in exchanging the excitement of a semi-barbarous
Court for the tranquillity of cantonment life and the
companionship of a gentle and amiable wife, the barter,
though not self-sought, had been greatly to his advantage.</p>

<p>Being appointed to the command of a horse-field battery,
stationed at Delhi, he left Dum-Dum for the imperial
city, where he continued to serve, until, shortly before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Sikh invasion, he attained that great object of regimental
ambition, the command of a troop of horse-artillery. In
the Upper Provinces, he had more than once been disquieted
by the illness of his young and fondly-loved wife;
but the heavy blow, which was to prostrate all his earthly
happiness, did not descend upon him until within a few
days of that memorable 18th of December, 1845, which
saw the British army fling itself upon the Sikh batteries
at Mudkhi. He was called away, as he touchingly said,
“from the open grave,” to be plunged into the excitement
of battle. It was at Ferozshuhur that D’Arcey
Todd, broken-hearted, with a strong presentiment of his
approaching end, declaring that he “only wished to live
that the grace of God and the love of Christ might prepare
him to leave a world in which there could be no
more joy for him,” led his troop, a second time, into
action, and perished in the unequal conflict: and among
the many who fell on that mournful day, there was not a
braver soldier or a better man.</p>

<p>On receiving intelligence of Todd’s departure from
Herat, Macnaghten’s first impulse had been to muster all
his available resources, and relying greatly on the “big
guns,” to make an immediate demonstration in the
direction of Herat, beating up the rebels on the Helmund,
and “crushing Aktur Khan” on our way to the western
frontier. He wrote to Rawlinson to prepare for the siege;
he wrote to Ross Bell in Scinde to send up all the heavy
guns in his part of the country, applying to the commissary
at Forezpore for draft bullocks, if they were not
to be obtained more readily; and he wrote to the Supreme
Government to send “as large a force as might be available,
and as speedily as possible, to Candahar, even if an
attack on Herat should not be meditated.” He was eager
for the opinions of every competent authority regarding
the facilities of an immediate movement on Herat. “Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
there any chance,” he wrote to Rawlinson, “of our mustering
heavy guns and force sufficient to attack the place
this year?” “What does Todd say of the best season
for operations, and what aid does he hope we might
obtain from people in and around Herat?” “What does
Sanders think of the means at our command for subduing
Herat?” “You may imagine,” he wrote, in another
letter to the same correspondent, “how anxious I am to
hear of Todd’s safety, and to learn the particulars of his
departure from Herat, and the proximate cause of that
important event, as well as his and your, and Sanders’
opinion, as to the practicability of operations against Herat
this season. I suppose if the force were to move from
Candahar by the middle of May, it would be time
enough. But will the requisite battering train be then
forthcoming? And shall we then have a <i>quantum suff</i> of
grain and camels?” “The Governor-General,” added the
Envoy, “will, I fear, if possible, do nothing.”</p>

<p>In this conjecture, at least, Macnaghten’s sagacity was
not at fault. Against an armed interference with the
affairs of Herat, Lord Auckland had always steadfastly
set his face. It was his belief that it was necessary to
establish ourselves firmly in Afghanistan before operating
upon Herat; but Macnaghten always declared that there
was no possibility of achieving the former object until the
latter had been accomplished, and was always clamorous
for the re-annexation of Herat to the dominions of Shah
Soojah. His instructions, however, were imperative.
Even after the departure of the Mission, the Governor-General
counselled a mild and forbearing course. “I
cannot,” he wrote to Macnaghten, “apprehend organised
invasion from Herat, though there may be a foray on the
frontier, which will not have the effect of making the
advent of Yar Mahomed popular in Zemindawer. I think
it, however, more likely that you will have to deal with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
letters and agents than with troops; and you ask me in
what manner you are to receive overtures which may be
made to you by Yar Mahomed. I would receive them
calmly and coldly, but not repulsively. I would show no
impatience to renew a Mission to Herat. I would have it
to be understood that the stoppage of the allowances was
unauthorised, and that the detachment of a brigade to the
citadel of Herat was not desired, and would not have been
acceded to by the British Government, but that the
conduct of the Vizier has given great offence, and that we
can regard Herat with no confidence or friendly feeling
until there shall have been on the side of that state an
entire change of policy. I can only repeat, therefore,
what I have said very many times within the last two
years: That you must be strong in Afghanistan before
you can hope to exercise a wholesome influence upon
Herat; and I am glad that you are giving your attention
to the condition of the internal government of the
country.”</p>

<p>But although the supreme authorities at Calcutta
would not countenance a movement upon Herat, it was
manifest at Candahar that the aggressive designs of Yar
Mahomed, who contemplated the seizure of Ghiresk, and
the hostile demonstrations of the Douranees in the western
districts, rendered active operations on our part a matter
of immediate necessity. So Rawlinson wrote officially to
the General that it appeared to him “of first-rate importance
that the insurrection in Zemindawer should be
crushed before the acquisition of any further strength
could render its co-operation of essential service to the
Wuzeer of Herat in his projected advance.” “I also
consider,” he added, “that the strengthening of our
position on the Helmund, and the indication of readiness
on our part to meet any such advance, would be the
most effectual way of checking the movement, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
frustrating its object.”<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> An intercepted letter from Aktur
Khan, announcing his intention to move from Zemindawer
directly upon Candahar, if encouraged by the tribes
occupying the intervening country, had been brought in to
the Political Agent, and it was obvious, therefore, that
no time was to be lost.</p>

<p>So a force was sent out to the Zemindawer country to
beat up Aktur Khan’s quarters, or to intercept his advance.
The political conduct of the expedition was entrusted to
Lieutenant Elliot, Rawlinson’s assistant; and ably he
did his duty. It was not our policy to beat the Douranees
in battle. It never could be our policy in that country
to shed the blood of the tribes. The submission, not the
destruction, of Aktur Khan was now the object to be
attained; and, as the chief was believed to muster not
more than 1300 followers, it was deemed probable that
the advance of our force would determine him, in the
diplomatic language of the day, to “come in.” Intimations
of his willingness to submit to terms met Elliot as he
advanced. An interview was arranged between them.
In the camp of the Douranee Sirdar, Atta Mahomed,
the young English “Political” met Aktur Khan, and
received his submission. A conditional pardon was
granted to the disaffected chief, some concessions were
made, and a dress of honour was conferred upon him. The
most important condition on his part was, that he should
disband his followers, and as it was believed that he would
fulfil his promise in this respect, hope was entertained
that the Zemindawer country would be tranquillised
without further shedding of blood. But, Rawlinson saw
plainly that the advantage which we had gained would be
short-lived. “I do not anticipate,” he wrote to Macnaghten,
“that by the conciliatory treatment recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
by Lieutenant Elliot, we gain any other advantage
than that of temporary tranquillity; and however
prudent therefore it may be at present to induce the rebel
chief of Zemindawer to abstain from disorders by the hope
of obtaining through his forbearance substantial personal
benefits, I still think that when the danger of foreign
aggression is removed, and efficient means are at our
disposal, the rights of His Majesty’s government should
be asserted in that strong and dignified manner which can
alone ensure a due respect being paid to his authority.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>And not the Douranees only, but the Ghilzyes
also in Western Afghanistan were, in the spring and
summer of 1841, revolting against the authorities of Shah
Soojah and his Feringhee supporters. Lieutenant Lynch,
an officer of the Bombay army, who had served in Persia
with the rank of major, was in political charge of the
country about Khelat-i-Ghilzye. The restlessness and
disaffection of the tribes he attributed to the fact that
the families of some of their chief people, who, after the
operations against them in 1839, had fled for safety to
the Sikh frontier, had at the instigation of the British
Envoy, been seized and cast into captivity. But, whatever
may have been the more remote cause, there was in
this spring of 1841, a proximate source of irritation in the
fact, that the English were rebuilding the fortress of
Khelat-i-Ghilzye, which lies between Caubul and Candahar,
with the design of posting there a strong garrison
to overcome the circumjacent tribes. This movement
had been regarded with great jealousy by the Ghilzyes;
and the tribes in the immediate neighbourhood had
assumed an insolent and defiant attitude. About two
miles from Khelat-i-Ghilzye, was a small fort, bristling
with armed men. As Lynch was riding past it, some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the people came out, and brandishing their swords defied
him to attack them. It was thought that if this insolence
were allowed to pass unnoticed, more serious acts of
aggression might be anticipated. So the troops at Khelat-i-Ghilzye
were summoned to attack the fort. Aided by
Captain Sanders of the engineers, Captain Macan, who
commanded one of the regiments of Shah Soojah’s force,
led his Hindostanees against the rebellious stronghold, and
captured it after a brave resistance. The chief and many
of his followers were slain in the conflict, and the irritation
of the Ghilzyes was greater than before.</p>

<p>It was a gallant military exploit, but a great misfortune;
and Lynch, whether he had judged rightly or wrongly
that the exigencies of the occasion demanded that he should
chastise the people who had insulted him, was condemned
both at Caubul and Calcutta. The Envoy wrote that he
had “foreseen the likelihood of the Ghilzyes resenting the
erection of a fort in the heart of their country;” but
asked, “Why should we go and knock our heads against
mud-forts? Why should we not have waited till the Ghilzyes
chose to attack us?” Lord Auckland declared his
opinion that Major Lynch’s proceedings had been
“marked by a vapouring and needless parade, most likely
to produce popular excitement.” And a little later,
Burnes, in a letter full of wise humanity, wrote to Lynch;
more in sorrow than in anger, saying, “I am one of those
altogether opposed to any further fighting in this country,
and I consider that we shall never settle Afghanistan at
the point of the bayonet.... As regards the
Ghilzyes, indeed, immense allowance ought to be made
for them; they were till within three generations the
Kings of Afghanistan, and carried their victorious arms to
the capital of Persia. It is expecting too much, therefore, to
hope for their being at once peaceful subjects; and as they
exhibited so much indisposition to the King’s Government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
it was, I think, right to build a fort at Khelat-i-Ghilzye, and
thus bridle them, thereby enabling us, in the heart of the
Ghilzye country, to protect those who were disposed to join
us, and gradually undermine our enemies.... Had I
been by, I would have said, ‘Build Khelat-i-Ghilzye, and pardon
all kinds of insolence, for those who win may laugh.’”</p>

<p>Major Lynch was removed from office. When all the
circumstances of the case came to be known, the Envoy
took a more favourable view of his conduct. But, whether
it were right or wrong in itself, its results were unfortunate.
They could not be otherwise. It was the inevitable
consequence of such proceedings that the bitterness and
the turbulence of the Ghilzyes should wax greater than
before, and that soon the aspect of affairs in the neighbourhood
of Khelat-i-Ghilzye should render more dragooning
necessary for the maintenance of the authority of the
Shah. It was expected that the whole country would rise
up against Macan’s detachment; so reinforcements were
urgently called for from Candahar. The hot weather had
by this time set in, and Nott was unwilling to expose his
troops to the burning sun. But the political necessity
was said to be great; Macan was in his danger; and no
troops could be spared from Caubul.</p>

<p>So Colonel Wymer, a good and successful officer, with
400 men of his own regiment (the 38th Sepoys), four
horse-artillery guns, and a party of Christie’s horse, took
the field in the month of May. The Ghilzyes, eager
for the conflict, moved down from Khelat-i-Ghilzye to
meet our advancing troops; and, on the 19th, gave
them battle. Night was beginning to fall when they
came up with Wymer’s camp at Assiai-Ilmee. A Ghilzye
chief of high estate, named Gool Mahomed, known as
the “Gooroo,” who had threatened Keane’s army
nearly two years before, was at the head of the tribes.
They came on with unwavering gallantry, but were met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
with a heavy fire from Hawkins’s guns, which, served
with equal rapidity and precision, committed mighty havoc
in their ranks. Upon this, the Ghilzyes, resolutely intending
to attack simultaneously both flanks and the
centre of Wymer’s force, divided themselves into three
columns; and, coolly and deliberately, they came down
sword in hand to the charge. Wymer had an extensive
convoy to protect. His movements, therefore, were
crippled; and he was compelled to stand on his defence.
But the destroying grape from the guns, and the steady
musketry fire of the Sepoys, sent back the Ghilzye
swordsmen again and again reeling under the iron
shower. For five busy hours continued that mortal
struggle; and then the Ghilzyes gave way. They had
greatly outnumbered our party, and they left many dead
on the field. All night long, too, the moving lights
announced that many more, both of killed and wounded,
were carried off to their camp.</p>

<p>Whilst in this manner efforts were being made to
tranquillise the Ghilzyes, the proceedings of Aktur Khan
and the Douranees were again exciting the apprehensions
of the Envoy. In spite of all our conciliatory efforts,
they had not been quieted. The chief, it has been seen,
had outwardly tendered his allegiance to the King, and
had received a dress of honour, with an assurance from
our political officers that the past would be forgotten.
The revenue officers, whom the Douranees detested, had
been removed. The old earless minister, Moollah Shikore,
had been replaced by Oosman Khan, a younger, an abler,
and a more honest man; and Macnaghten was contemplating
other fiscal reforms than those which he had
already sanctioned, and hoping to restore the tribes to
their allegiance. But their disaffection was too deeply
rooted to be operated upon by such measures. The
entire system of government was offensive to them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
presence of the British was a perennial source of irritation.
What they regarded as their legitimate influence had been
usurped by the Feringhees; and they were soon ready
again to appear in the field, and cross their sabres with
the foreign bayonets.</p>

<p>It was obvious, indeed, as the month of May wore to
an end, that, unable to obtain all that he wanted for
himself, Aktur Khan was still our bitter and implacable
foe. Instead of disbanding his followers, he was collecting
them for another struggle. Irritated by this, Macnaghten
wrote to Rawlinson (May 31) as he had before written in
the case of Dost Mahomed, that if he could seize Aktur
Khan, he would recommend his execution. “I think,”
he said, “you should strain every nerve to lay hold of
that indomitable Moofsid, Aktur Khan, and that if you
can seize him, the Prince should be recommended to
execute him.... I further think that a reward of
10,000 rupees should be offered for the apprehension of
Aktur Khan.” But it was still difficult to persuade the
Envoy that the country was in an unsettled state. The
Ghilzyes and the Douranees were both in arms against
the authority of the Shah and his supporters. The whole
country of Western Afghanistan was in a fearful state of
unrest. Rawlinson, at Candahar, who saw clearly at this
time the frail tenure by which we held our position in
Afghanistan, was continually warning the Envoy of the
dangers which loomed so largely before him. But Macnaghten
only censured his correspondent for his “unwarrantably
gloomy views,” and denounced everything
that was said about the unsettled state of the country as
an “idle statement.” How unwilling he was to believe
that the clouds were gathering over his head, may be
gleaned from his correspondence with Rawlinson at this
time. On the 13th of June he wrote a long letter, in
which he thus emphatically declared his opinions:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">Your letter of the 7th arrived this morning. I don’t like
reverting to unpleasant discussions, but you know well that I have
been frank with you from the beginning, and that I have invariably
told you of what I thought I had reason to complain. This may
be confined to one topic&mdash;your taking an unwarrantably gloomy
view of our position, and entertaining and disseminating rumours
favourable to that view. We have enough of difficulties and
enough of croakers without adding to the number needlessly. I
have just seen a letter from Mr. Dallas to Captain Johnson, in which
he says the state of the country is becoming worse and worse every
day. These idle statements may cause much mischief, and, often
repeated as they are, they neutralise my protestations to the contrary.
I know them to be utterly false as regards this part of the
country, and I have no reason to believe them to be true as regards
your portion of the kingdom, merely because the Tokhees are
indulging in their accustomed habits of rebellion, or because Aktur
Khan has a pack of ragamuffins at his heels. As I have said before,
there is nothing in these matters which might not have been foreseen,
or which ought to cause us the slightest uneasiness. We will
take such precautions as shall prevent the Ghilzyes from annoying
us; and this is all that is requisite for the present. We may safely
leave the rest to time. As to the documents protesting against the
appointment of Sunmud, I look upon them as pure fudge. Send
for the Janbaz. Let them make a forced march by night, and come
in the rear of Aktur. Seize the villain, and hang him as high as
Haman, and you will probably have no more disturbances. The
Janbaz may remain out while the collections are going on, if
necessary. I have already explained to you that I never intended
offering a reward for Aktur’s head, nor should I approve of encouraging
the man who has a blood-feud with him to put him out
of the way. This, besides being objectionable, would be superfluous,
because his enemy must know that we could not be otherwise than
gratified at the removal of so atrocious a traitor. With regard to
the Tymunees, all I meant was, that they should be encouraged to
seize Aktur if he attempted to take refuge in their territory, and I
thought that a large pecuniary reward would be necessary to overcome
their natural scruples to such a proceeding.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p class="p1">But these Douranee children were now again to be
corrected. Though “all was content and tranquillity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
from Mookoor to the Khybur,” it was necessary that our
troops should be continually in the field. And it was
not always child’s play in which they were summoned
to engage. Aktur Khan was, at the end of June, still
in arms before Ghiresk, with a body of three thousand
men, and it was necessary to strike a blow at the rebel
chief. Macnaghten saw the necessity of “tolerating his
audacity no longer,” and although he, at first thought
that a “judicious use of the Janbaz would extirpate the
villain,” he consented to send out a regular force against
the rebel chief to “hunt him to the world’s end.”</p>

<p>So Woodburn, a fine dashing officer, who commanded
one of the Shah’s regiments, was sent out against him,
with his own corps (the 5th Infantry), two detachments
of Janbaz, or Afghan Horse, under Hart and Golding, and
some guns of the Shah’s Horse Artillery, under Cooper.
On the 3rd of July he found the enemy posted on the
other side of the Helmund river; mustering, it was said
afterwards, six thousand men, in six divisions, with a
Moollah, or priest at the head of each, and with each
a standard, bearing the inscription, “we have been trusting
in God; may he guide and guard us!”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Woodburn
tried the fords, but they were impassable. Hart, however,
had passed them at another point, but, finding himself
unsupported, he returned. This was in early morning.
Four hours after noon the enemy struck their camp, and
soon afterwards commenced the passage of the river.
Woodburn made his arrangements for their reception.
The Douranees made a spirited attack, but Woodburn’s
infantry, well supported by Cooper’s guns, met them with
too prompt and sure a fire to encourage them to greater
boldness. The Janbaz, already graduating in treachery
and cowardice, covered themselves with that peculiar kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of glory which clung to them to the end of the war. It
was a busy night. The enemy far outnumbered Woodburn;
but the steady gallantry of his gunners and his
footmen achieved the success they deserved. Before daybreak
the enemy had withdrawn. It would have been a
great thing to have followed up and dispersed the rebels,
but with all the country against him, and a body of horse
at his back on which no reliance could be placed, it would
have been madness to make the attempt. So Woodburn,
having written for reinforcements, pushed on to Ghiresk,
whence he wrote that he believed the rebellion was far
more extensive than was supposed, and that the population
of Candahar were quite as disaffected as the rebels on the
banks of the Helmund.</p>

<p>The month of August, however, found the Envoy still
cheerful and sanguine. The convulsions of the Douranees
and the spasms of the Ghilzyes were regarded by him as
the accompaniments only of those infantine fevers which
were inseparable from the existence of the tribes. In
vain Rawlinson, with steady eye watching those symptoms,
and probing with deep sagacity the causes of the
mortal ailments out of which arose all those fierce throes
of anguish, protested that throughout Western Afghanistan
there was a strong national feeling against us; and
that difficulties and dangers were coiling their serpent
folds around us with irresistible force. Macnaghten still
asked what we had to fear, and thus, on the 2nd of
August, addressed his less sanguine colleague:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">I am not going to read you a lecture, first, because when you
indited your letter of the 28th ult. you pleaded guilty to the
influence of bile; and secondly, because at the present writing I
must own the same impeachment; but I must pen a few remarks,
in the hope of inducing you to regard matters a little more “<i>couleur
de rose</i>.” You say, “The state of the country causes me many
an anxious thought&mdash;we may thresh the Douranees over and over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
again, but this rather aggravates than obviates the difficulty of
overcoming the national feeling against us&mdash;in fact, our tenure
is positively that of military possession, and the French in Algiers,
and the Russians in Circassia, afford us an example on a small
scale of the difficulty of our position.” Now upon what do you
found your assertion that there is a national feeling against us,
such as that against the French in Algiers or the Russians in
Circassia? Solely, so far as I know, because the turbulent Douranees
have risen in rebellion. From Mookoor to the Khybur
Pass all is content and tranquillity, and wherever we Europeans
go we are received with respect, and attention, and welcome.
But the insurrection of the Douranees is no new occurrence. The
history of the rule of the Barukzye Sirdars would show that they
were engaged in one continuous struggle with their turbulent
brethren. If they were able to reduce them to subjection with
their contemptible means, what should we have to fear from them?
We have given them something to lose which they had not before,
and you may rely upon it that they will be quiet enough as soon
as they are satisfied (which they ought to be pretty well by this
time) of the futility of opposition, provided some means are
adopted of preventing Yar Mahomed from carrying on his intrigues.
Then, the Ghilzyes have been in arms. True. But it would have
been unreasonable to suppose that they should surrender their
independance without a struggle, and we have now put the bit in
their mouths. I do not concur with you as to the difficulty of
our position. On the contrary, I think our prospects are most
cheering, and with the materials we have there ought to be little
or no difficulty in the management of the country.</p>

<p>It is true the population is exclusively Mahomedan, but it is
split into rival sects; and we all know that of all antipathies the
sectarian is the most virulent. We have Hazaras, Ghilzyes, Douranees,
and Kuzzilbashes, all at daggers drawn with each other,
and in every family there are rivals and enemies. Some faults of
management must necessarily be committed on the first assumption
of the administration of a new country, and the Douranee outbreak
may be partially attributed to such faults; but what, after all, do
such outbreaks signify? The modern history of India teems with
such instances. There is hardly a district in which some desperate
adventurer has not appeared at some time or other, and drawn the
entire population after him. The whole province of Bareilly, in
1817, rose against us on a religious war-cry. The whole province
of Cuttack, shortly afterwards, followed the standard of the rebel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Jugbeneda, and we had infinite trouble in quelling the insurrection.
Instances of this kind might be infinitely multiplied, and yet we
find the effects of such outbreaks are very evanescent. The people
of this country are very credulous. They believe any story
invented to our prejudice; but they will very soon learn that we
are not the cannibals we are painted. Mr. Gorman’s fate was doubtless
very melancholy; but are there no assassinations in other
countries? I read in the <i>Bombay Times</i> only this morning an
account of a cavalry officer being shot at in the open day in one
of our villages. You say, “The infatuated towns-people are even
beginning now to show their teeth; there have been three cases
to-day of stones thrown from the tops of the houses on Sepoys’
heads walking along the streets.” Certainly our troops can be no
great favourites in a town where they have turned out half the
inhabitants for their own accommodation; but I will venture to
say there is not a county town in England where soldiers are
quartered in which similar excesses have not happened. European
and Native soldiers have traversed the town of Candahar unarmed;
and though it is to be apprehended that their conduct has been
occasionally very aggravating, only two assaults have been committed
upon them. When I went to Hyderabad in 1810, and for
many years after, no European could venture to show himself in
the city, such was the state of feeling against us. Look upon this
picture and on that. Now I believe the lieges of Hyderabad look
upon us as very innocent Kaffirs.</p>

<p>You are quite right, I think in directing Pattinson to accept
the submission of all the rebels, save Aktur, who may be desirous
of coming in. They should be required to furnish security for
appearance sake. But these people are perfect children, and
should be treated as such. If we put one naughty boy in the
corner, the rest will be terrified. We have taken their plaything,
power, out of the hands of the Douranee chiefs, and they are
pouting a good deal in consequence. They did not know how to
use it. In their hands it was useless and even hurtful to their
master, and we were obliged to transfer it to scholars of our own.
They instigate the Moollahs, and the Moollahs preach to the people;
but this will be very temporary. The evil of it we must have
borne with, or abandoned all hope of forming a national army.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">The Douranee children, however, required more chastisement.
No man could have done more than Woodburn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
did with his means; but those means were insufficient.
It was the custom then, both against the Ghilzyes
and the Douranees, to send out detachments sufficiently
large to accomplish, with the aid of their guns, small
victories over the enemy, and so to increase the bitterness
of their hostility, without breaking their strength. Aktur
Khan was still in arms. Banded with him was Akrum
Khan, another Douranee chief, inspired with like bitter
hatred of the restored monarch and his Feringhee allies.
A force under Captain Griffin, who had been sent to
reinforce Woodburn at Ghiresk, now went out against
them. It was strong in the mounted branch. Eight
hundred sabres, three hundred and fifty bayonets, and
four six-pounder guns, followed Griffin into the field of
Zemindawer. On the 17th of August he came up with
the insurgents. It was a moment of some anxiety. The
<i>Janbaz</i> had not by their conduct under Woodburn won
the confidence of the British officers. Nott always mistrusted
them, and the feeling was, not unreasonably,
shared by others.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> But here they were associated with
the men of the King’s regular cavalry, and they may
have felt the danger of defection. Be the cause what
it may, they did not shrink from the encounter. The
enemy were strongly posted in a succession of walled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
gardens and small forts, from which they opened a heavy
matchlock fire upon our advancing troops; but the fire of
our guns and musketry drove them from their inclosures,
and then the cavalry, headed by the young Prince Sufder
Jung, who had something more than the common energy
of the royal race, charged with terrific effect, and utterly
broke the discomfited mass of Douranees. The victory
was a great one. Aktur Khan fled. The Douranees were
disheartened; and for a time they sunk into the repose of
feebleness and exhaustion.</p>

<p>The Ghilzyes, too, had received another check. Colonel
Chambers, early in August, had been sent out against
them, with a party of his own regiment, (the 5th Light
Cavalry), the 16th and 43rd Sepoy Regiments, and some
details of Irregular Horse. He came up with the enemy
on the morning of the 5th; but before he could bring the
main body of his troops into action, a party of his cavalry
had fallen upon them and scattered them in disastrous
flight. There was nothing left for them after this but
submission; and soon the chief instigator of the movement
had “come in” to our camp.</p>

<p>Under the influence of these victories, Macnaghten’s
confidence rose higher and higher. The Douranees were
broken, and the Ghilzyes had submitted “almost without
a blow.” Aktur Khan had fled, and the “Gooroo”
had surrendered. Now, indeed, the Envoy thought that
he might report “all quiet from Dan to Beersheba.” If
anything caused him a moment’s inquietude, it was the
thought that Akbar Khan, the favourite son of Dost
Mahomed, was still abroad, hovering about Khooloom.
With something that now seems like a strange presentiment,
he wrote that “the fellow would be after some
mischief, should the opportunity present itself.” It was
on the 20th of August that, writing to Mr. Robertson,
he thus expressed himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">The victory of the Helmund was very complete. I believe the
enemy on that occasion was as numerous a body as could ever be
congregated in this country, consisting of some 4000 or 5000 men.
The Douranees want one more threshing, and then they would be
quite satisfied of the futility of opposing us; but my last letter
from Rawlinson gave me no hope that they would collect again.
The whole of the Ghilzye tribes have submitted almost without a
blow; for the gallant little affair in which the 5th Cavalry redeemed
the honour of that branch of the service, could hardly be dignified
with the name of a fight. Those who knew this country when it
was ruled by Barukzyes, are amazed at the metamorphosis it has
undergone, and with so little bloodshed. The former rulers were
eternally fighting with their subjects from one year’s end to another.
Now we cannot move a <i>naick</i> and four without having all the newspapers
setting up a yell about the unpopularity of the Shah. The
Shah is unpopular with the Douranee Khans, and we have made
him so by supplanting them, and taking the military power which
they were incompetent to use from their hands into our own.
With all other classes his Majesty is decidedly, but deservedly,
popular, and the Khans are too contemptible to be cared about.</p>

<p>We have had very unpleasant intelligence from Bokhara, it being
reported that Colonel Stoddart is again in disgrace and confinement;
and I am the more alarmed about this, from thinking it probable
that Arthur Conolly will return from Kokund <i>viâ</i> Bokhara. But
the intelligence requires confirmation. Mahomed Akbar, the Dost’s
favourite son, is still at Khooloom, and has rejected my overture to
come in. The fellow will be after some mischief, should the opportunity
present itself.... You will see that Shah Soojah has
most handsomely given back Cutchee and Moostung to the young
Khan of Khelat. His Majesty’s revenue is little more than fifteen
lakhs per annum&mdash;hardly enough for the maintenance of his personal
state&mdash;and yet the government below are perpetually writing
to me that this charge and that charge is to be defrayed out of his
“Majesty’s resources!” God help the poor man and his resources!!
The country is perfectly quiet from Dan to Beersheba.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">But, although the Envoy thus on the 20th of August,
wrote to his private friends in the provinces of India that all
was quiet from Dan to Beersheba, he was at this very time
making arrangements for the despatch from Candahar of a
large force to the Tereen and Dehrawut country on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
north-western frontier of Afghanistan. “The northern
districts,” he wrote to General Elphinstone on the 21st of
August, “have been in a state of rebellion, and the chiefs
of those districts (of whom one Akrum Khan is the head)
have refused to wait upon His Majesty’s representative;
have been in constant correspondence with the rebel Aktur
Khan, and have assembled a considerable number of
armed followers, with a view to defy His Majesty’s
authority. The arrival of the 16th and 43rd regiments
of Native Infantry will admit of a force being detached
from that garrison; and I am officially made acquainted
with the opinion of the political agent at Candahar to the
effect that it is necessary to send an expedition into the
disturbed districts, with a view either to expel the offending
chiefs or to enforce their submission.”</p>

<p>So, orders were sent to Candahar for the equipment of
another force for field-service, with instructions to complete
the necessary work in the least possible space of
time, in order that three regiments of Native Infantry,
which were under orders to leave the serene and prosperous
country, might turn their faces towards India at
the beginning of November. By the end of the first
week of September the force was ready to commence its
march&mdash;a difficult, toilsome and hazardous march into
an unknown country. Two regiments of the Company’s
Bengal Infantry (the 2nd and 38th), a regiment of the
Shah’s cavalry, two Horse-Artillery guns of the same
service, a company of European Artillery with two 18-pounder
guns, and a detachment of Sappers, composed
the force. It was in good condition; well equipped at
all points; and it started with a month’s supplies.</p>

<p>The force was commanded by Colonel Wymer. Nott
saw it depart with mortification and regret which he did
not desire to conceal. Some time before he had received
instructions from head-quarters not to leave Candahar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
where his presence was conceived to be expedient; and
he still believed that those instructions were in force.
Eager, therefore, as he was, to place himself at the head
of his men, he deemed it to be his duty, as a soldier, to
remain in garrison while he delegated the command to
another. But while to the officer he had selected to take
the envied post he issued comprehensive instructions for
his guidance in the field, he, at the same time, wrote
to the officer commanding in Afghanistan, respectfully
expressing his “deep regret that so large a portion of the
force under his orders should be despatched on what
might prove to be a difficult service, without his being
permitted to assume the command.” The answer returned
to this last letter entirely removed all restrictions on
Nott’s movements; so the general at once prepared himself
to take command of the force.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the troops had marched. The
political conduct of the expedition had been entrusted to
Lieutenant Elliot, who had been summoned for this
purpose from Khelat-i-Ghilzye, where he had been
placed on the removal of Lynch. Every effort had been
made to obtain reliable information relative to the
country which they were about to traverse; but the
want of local knowledge was severely felt, and the
difficulties of the march, encumbered as was the force
with heavy guns, was greater than had been anticipated.
Nott joined the force on the 23rd of September; and
they pushed on into the Dehrawut country. But it was
soon apparent that so formidable a display of force would
achieve without bloodshed the objects of the expedition.
Early in the month of October many of the principal Douranee
chiefs were in Nott’s camp. They had never before
seen our regular troops, which now, paraded and exercised
before them, made a strong impression on their minds.
They gazed at and handled our heavy guns with wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
apprehension, and confessed that they had no desire
to test their quality. It was said throughout the war,
that our guns were the best “politicals,” but Elliot’s
diplomacy was not unsuccessfully exerted, and the chiefs
professed their willingness to proceed to Caubul and make
submission to the Shah.</p>

<p>But there was one who refused to submit. The
indomitable spirit of Akrum Khan was proof against all
promises and all threats. He did not come into Nott’s
camp; but held aloof, still eager, it was said, to give us
battle. It was our policy to seize the rebel chief; and
this was now to be done. One of his own countrymen
undertook to betray him. It was suspected that the
man had no real intention to lead us to the lair of the
hostile Douranee; but, after the manner of his nation, to
obtain money from us and then to lead our troops astray.
But Elliot grasped the proposal, with a tenacity of purpose
which baffled all fraud and defeated all evasion. He
went to the general, and obtained his permission to send
a regiment of Janbaz, under John Conolly, to beat up the
quarters of Akrum Khan. There was little expectation
in camp that the forces would be successful. But Conolly
did his work well. It is said that the feet of the guide
were tied under his horse’s belly to prevent his escape.
A rapid march brought them to a small fort, where
Akrum Khan was preparing to betake himself to the
hills. A few hours’ delay would have been fatal to the
success of the expedition. But now its great object was
attained. The rebel Douranee was surprised, seized, and
carried back, a prisoner, to Nott’s camp. The expedition
had scarcely occupied thirty-six hours.</p>

<p>The rest is soon told. The unfortunate chief was
carried a doomed captive to Candahar. Macnaghten,
whose letters written at this time show how all his finer
feelings had been blunted by the rude work in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
he was engaged, had persuaded the King that it was
necessary to make a terrible example of some of the
disturbers of the public peace. Prince Timour was then
the governor of Candahar. He had recently been sent
to the western capital to take the place of his brother
Futteh Jung, whose detestable character had rendered
his removal necessary; and the change was one greatly
for the better. Timour was a man of respectable reputation;
mild, indolent, and compliant. He governed
according to the behests of his English supporters, and
had little will of his own. He now directed or authorised,
under instructions from Caubul, the execution of
the Douranee prisoner; and so Akrum Khan was blown
from a gun.</p>

<p>Before the end of October, Nott had returned to Candahar
with the greater part of the force; and Lieutenant
Crawford had been despatched to Caubul with the Douranee
chiefs who had tendered their submission. There
was now really a prospect of tranquillity in Western
Afghanistan; for both the Ghilzye and the Douranee
confederacy had been crushed; and the facility with
which we had moved our regular troops and our heavy
guns into the most difficult parts of the country had
demonstrated to the turbulent tribes the difficulty of
escaping the vengeance of the Feringhees, and had produced
a good moral effect among people who had before
only known us from report.</p>

<p><span class="beg">Taking</span> advantage of the lull that followed the defeat
of the Douranees and the Ghilzyes in Western Afghanistan,
let us dwell for a little space on the general condition
of affairs at the capital, in this month of September.</p>

<p>The King was in the Balla Hissar. Discontented
and unhappy, he complained that he had no real authority;
that the English gentlemen were managing the
affairs of his kingdom; and that he himself was a mere
pageant and a show. He had watched with satisfaction
the growth of the difficulties which were besetting the
path of his allies, and was not without a hope that their
further development would be attended by our withdrawal
from so troubled a sphere. It was plain to him
that, although deference was outwardly shown to his
opinions, and a pretence of consulting his wishes was
made by his British advisers, they really held all the
power in their hands; and he said, complainingly, to one
of them,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> for whom he entertained no little personal
affection, that he “did not understand his position.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
appointment of the new minister, Oosman Khan, in the
place of his old and tried servant, Moollah Shikore, had
been extremely distasteful to him; and it chafed him to
think that a functionary so appointed must necessarily be
less eager to fulfil his wishes than those of his European
allies. His health, too, was failing at this time; he was
nervous and irritable, and Macnaghten thinking that he
saw symptoms of approaching dissolution, contemplated
the expediency of bringing Prince Timour from Candahar
to the capital. “His Majesty,” he wrote to Rawlinson,
on the 21st of September, “is ill of a fever, which has been
hanging about him for some time, and at his time of life,
the issue, to say the least of it, is very doubtful. It
seems to be in the highest degree desirable that Shah-zadah
Timour should be here in the event of a fatal termination
of His Majesty’s illness. The Nizamoodowlah
and I have had a serious conversation this morning on
the subject. He thinks, and I am disposed to agree with
him, that it might be well if the Shah-zadah were to
address an <i>areeza</i> to His Majesty, stating how much
grieved he is to hear of His Majesty’s illness, the intelligence
of which has filled him with so much uneasiness as
to incapacitate him for the proper performance of the
duties of government, and expressing an earnest desire
to kiss the feet of His Majesty, and thereby give relief
to his mind.” But the old man rallied, and Macnaghten
rejoiced. At such a time, a succession would have
been embarrassing and inopportune, for the Envoy was
preparing to shake the dust of Afghanistan from his feet
for ever.</p>

<p>He was about to receive the reward of a life of successful
and appreciated service, and to end his official
days in comparative quiet and repose. He was about to
escape out of the cares and inquietudes&mdash;the difficulties
and dangers&mdash;the incessant harassing turmoil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
excitement of a life of responsibility among a turbulent
and discontented people, and to commence a new career
of useful and honoured public service, upon a less
stormy and tumultuous scene. He had been appointed
Governor of Bombay. The same recognition of approved
zeal and capacity which had been extended to Malcolm
and Elphinstone, had now come to testify the estimation
in which Macnaghten’s services were held by his employers.
It was a high and flattering mark of confidence,
and it was doubly welcome after all the doubts
and misgivings engendered in his mind by the implied
censures of his immediate superior. The value of the
gift, too, was enhanced by the seasonableness of the time
at which it was received. Macnaghten looked around
him, and saw that “everything was quiet from Dan to
Beersheba;” and he rejoiced in the thought that he was
about to quit Afghanistan for ever, and to carry with him
no burden of anxiety and fear.</p>

<p>Burnes was also at Caubul. He had been there ever
since the restoration of the Shah, in a strange unrecognised
position, of which it is difficult to give any intelligible
account. He used to say, that he was in the “most
nondescript of situations.” It appears to have been his
mission in Afghanistan to draw a large salary every
month, and to give advice that was never taken. This
might have satisfied many men. It did not satisfy
Burnes. He said that he wanted responsibility; and
under Macnaghten he had none. He had no precise
duties of any kind; but he watched all that was going
on in Afghanistan with a penetrating eye and an understanding
brain, and he wrote, in the shape of letters to
Macnaghten, long and elaborate papers on the state and
prospects of Afghanistan, which his official chief dismissed
with a few pencil-notes for the most part of contemptuous
dissent. Burnes saw clearly that everything was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
wrong. He probed, deeply and searchingly, the great
wound of national discontent&mdash;a mighty sore that was
ever running&mdash;and he felt in his inmost soul that the
death-throes of such a system could not be very remote.
But better days were now beginning to dawn upon him.
He had been waiting for Macnaghten’s office, and now, at
last, it seemed to be within his reach. A few weeks, and
he would be supreme at Caubul; and the great object of
his ambition gained.</p>

<p>The command of the troops was in the hands of
General Elphinstone&mdash;an old officer of the Queen’s service,
of good repute, gentlemanly manners, and aristocratic
connections. He had succeeded Sir Willoughby Cotton
in the early part of the year. But it must have been a
wonder to him, as it was to all who knew him, what
business he had in such a place. He had no Indian
experience of any kind, and he was pressed down by
physical infirmities. When Sir Willoughby Cotton
intimated his desire, on the plea of ill health, to be relieved
from the command of the troops in Afghanistan,
there was an officer already in the country to whom
their charge might have been safely delegated. But he
was not in favour either at the Mission or at the
Calcutta Government House. Sir Jasper Nicolls would
have placed Nott in command; but there were obstacles
to his appointment, at which I have already hinted; and
it was deemed expedient to send to Caubul a man of a
more ductile nature, with as few opinions of his own as
might be, to clash with those of the political chief. So
Lord Auckland despatched General Elphinstone to Afghanistan&mdash;not
in ignorance of his disqualifications, for
they were pointed out to him by others&mdash;but in spite of
a clear perception of them. Whether those who sent
the brave old gentleman to India with all his infirmities
thick upon him, recommended him for this especial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
field of service, or whether any notions of routine and
the obligations of the roster pressed themselves upon
Lord Auckland with irresistible force, I cannot confidently
declare; but so inexplicable by any reference to
intelligible human motives and actions is an appointment
of this kind, that it is impossible not to recognise
in such a dispensation a mightier agency than that of
man, or to reject the belief that, when Elphinstone went
to Caubul, the curse which sate upon our unholy policy
was working onward for our overthrow.</p>

<p>Next in rank to General Elphinstone were Sir Robert
Sale and Brigadier Shelton&mdash;both officers of the Queen’s
service, but soldiers of long Indian experience. Each had
served with his regiment in the Burmese war; and each
had acquired a reputation for the highest personal courage.
Sale’s regiment was the 13th Light Infantry. Shelton’s
was the 44th.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Both of these regiments were now at
Caubul. But the 13th was about to return to India, and
soon afterwards to great Britain. It had seen many years
of Indian service, and had been in Afghanistan since
Keane’s army first entered the country. The 44th had
come up early in the year, and had done some service in
the Naziain valley, near Jellalabad, on the way.</p>

<p>The command of the Shah’s troops was vested in Brigadier
Anquetil, a native of one of those lovely islands in the
Channel which have sent forth so many brave men to fight
our battles by sea and land. He was esteemed a good
soldier; and I believe that Macnaghten found him a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
pliant colleague than the “alarmist” whom he had supplanted.
The controversies between Brigadier Roberts
and the Envoy had ended in the departure of the former.
His advice had been resented; his warnings had been
scouted. His clear insight into the dangers which were
beneath our feet had been regarded as idle and imbecile
fear; and the unwelcome declarations of his honest
convictions as little short of rank mutiny. He had done
his duty; he had spoken the truth; and he had paid the
inevitable penalty of his unwillingness to make an easy
and a prosperous present at the cost of a tumultuous and
disastrous future. He had returned in disgrace to the
British provinces; but he had left his predictions behind
him, and he knew that, sooner or later, History would do
him justice.</p>

<p>The main body of the British troops were in the new
cantonments. These works had been erected in the course
of 1840. They were situated on a piece of low ground
open to the Kohistan road. They were extensive and ill
defended. They were nearly a mile in extent, and were
surrounded by ramparts so little formidable that they
might be ridden over.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Near the cantonments was the
Mission compound, occupying an extensive space, and surrounded
by a number of houses and buildings belonging
to the officers and retainers of the Mission. There was
here, also, a weak attempt at defence; but the walls were
beyond measure contemptible; and the whole expanse of
building, the entrenched camp and Mission compound
together, were so planted, as to be swept on every side by
hills, and forts, and villages, and whatever else in such a
country could bristle with armed men. No such works
were ever known&mdash;so wretched in themselves, and so
doubly wretched by position. If the object of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
constructed them had been to place our troops at the
mercy of an enemy, they could not have been devised
more cunningly in furtherance of such an end. They were
commanded on every side; and so surrounded with villages,
forts, gardens, and other cover for an enemy, that our
troops could neither enter nor leave the camp without
exposing themselves to a raking fire from some one of these
points of attack. And to crown the calamity of the whole,
the Commissariat supplies, on which our army depended
for its subsistence, were stored in a small fort, not within,
but beyond, the cantonments. The communication between
the two places was commanded by an empty fort,
and by a walled garden, inviting the occupation of an
enemy. Human folly seemed to have reached its height
in the construction of these works. There stood those
great, indefensible cantonments, overawed on every side, a
monument of the madness which Providence, for its own
ends, had permitted to cloud and bewilder the intelligence
of the “greatest military nation of the world.” There it
stood, a humiliating spectacle; but except by new-comers,
who stood in amazement before the great folly, little account
was taken of it. Men’s eyes had become accustomed to the
blot.</p>

<p>And whose was this stupendous error? Are we to assign
its origin to the professional incapacity of the engineer
officers attached to the force; to the ignorance and
carelessness of the officers commanding it; or to the wilfulness
of the Envoy? Not to the engineers&mdash;Durand,
who had first held the post, had urged upon the Envoy the
necessity of constructing barracks and posting our troops
in the Balla Hissar; and Macnaghten, yielding to these
solicitations, had overcome the reluctance of the Shah&mdash;but
the barracks had been afterwards given up to the
accommodation of the old king’s harem; and from that time,
though Sturt who succeeded Durand, insisted, with equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
urgency on the expediency of locating the troops in the
Balla Hissar, and strengthening its defences, all hope of
securing a strong military position at Caubul was gone.
The sheep-folds on the plain were built. When Brigadier
Roberts, in the spring of 1840, saw that the work had
commenced, and what it was proposed to do, he remonstrated
against the plan; and was told that it had been
approved by Sir Willoughby Cotton. The Brigadier had
been connected with the Building Department in the upper
provinces of India, and freighted his remonstrances, therefore,
with much professional experience, bearing upon the
sanatory as well as upon the defensive aspects of the
question; but, although he believed at first that he had
made some impression on the Envoy, his protests were
disregarded. And so the cantonments had sprung up,
such as we have described them; and there, in that late
autumn of 1841, they stood, bare and defenceless, as sheep-pens,
whilst the wolves were howling around them.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>The English had by this time begun to settle themselves
down in Caubul. Indeed, from the very commencement,
they had done their best, as they ever do, to accommodate
themselves to new localities and new circumstances, and
had transplanted their habits, and, I fear it must be
added, their vices, with great address, to the capital of
the Douranee Empire. It was plain that they were
making themselves at home in the chief city of the
Afghans. There was no sign of an intended departure.
They were building and furnishing houses for themselves&mdash;laying
out gardens&mdash;surrounding themselves with the
comforts and luxuries of European life. Some had sent
for their wives and children. Lady Macnaghten, Lady
Sale, and other English women, were domesticated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
comfortable houses within the limits of the great folly
we had erected on the plain. The English, indeed, had
begun to find the place not wholly unendurable. The
fine climate braced and exhilarated them. There was no
lack of amusement. They rode races; they played at
cricket. They got up dramatic entertainments. They
went out fishing; they went out shooting. When winter
fell upon them, and the heavy frosts covered the lakes
with ice, to the infinite astonishment of the Afghans they
skimmed over the smooth surface on their skates. There
is no want of manliness among the Afghans; but the
manliness of the Feringhee strangers quite put them to
shame. They did not like us the less for that. The
athletic amusements of our people only raised their
admiration. But there was something else which filled
them with intensest hate.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>I am not writing an apology. There are truths which
must be spoken. The temptations which are most difficult
to withstand, were not withstood by our English officers.
The attractions of the women of Caubul they did not
know how to resist. The Afghans are very jealous of the
honour of their women; and there were things done in
Caubul which covered them with shame and roused them
to revenge. The inmate of the Mahomedan Zenana was
not unwilling to visit the quarters of the Christian
stranger. For two long years, now, had this shame been
burning itself into the hearts of the Caubulees; and
there were some men of note and influence among them
who knew themselves to be thus wronged. Complaints
were made; but they were made in vain. The scandal
was open, undisguised, notorious. Redress was not to be
obtained. The evil was not in course of suppression. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
went on till it became intolerable; and the injured then
began to see that the only remedy was in their own
hands. It is enough to state broadly this painful fact.
There are many who can fill in with vivid personality all
the melancholy details of this chapter of human weakness,
and supply a catalogue of the wrongs which were soon to
be so fearfully redressed.</p>

<p>Such, dimly traced in its social aspects, was the
general condition of things at Caubul in this month of
September, 1841. Politically&mdash;such was Macnaghten’s
conviction&mdash;everything was quiet from Dan to Beersheba.
The noses of the Douranee Khans had, he said, “been
brought to the grindstone;” and the Gooroo and other
Ghilzye chiefs were in his safe keeping at Caubul, seemingly
contented with their lot. As the month advanced
the Envoy continued to write that our prospects were
“brightening in every direction,” that everything was
“<i>couleur de rose</i>.” It is true that Eldred Pottinger, who
after a brief visit to the British provinces had returned
to Afghanistan, was not sending in very favourable reports
from the Kohistan and the Nijrow country, which were
now his new sphere of action; but of these troubles Macnaghten
made light account. He believed that Pottinger
was an alarmist. It is true, also, that an expedition was
going out to Zao, to reduce some turbulent robber tribes;
but this necessity he attributed to the indiscretion of one
of our own officers, who had needlessly attacked the place
with insufficient means, and been compelled to beat a
retreat.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The expedition, too, as Macnaghten said, was
only a “little go;” and immensely popular with our
officers, who were zealously volunteering for the sport,
as though it had been a battu or a steeple-chase.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The popular expedition into the Zoormut country was
completely successful. Macgregor, who accompanied the
force in the character of political adviser, found the rebellious
forts evacuated. He had only, therefore, to destroy
them. The results, however, of the movement were not
wholly pacificatory. Pottinger said that the feeling which
it engendered in the Kohistan was extremely unfavourable
to us. It confirmed, he said, in the minds of the malcontents,
“the belief so industriously spread of our difficulties,
whilst rumours from Herat and Candahar of
invasion, renewed rebellion, and disturbances, were again
spread abroad.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>During the early part of October the Kohistanees
remained perfectly quiet. But every hour, said Pottinger,
“brought rumours of the formation of an extensive conspiracy.”
These he at first doubted; but he reported
them to the Envoy, and asked for information on the
subject. The answer was, that neither Macnaghten nor
Burnes could perceive any grounds for suspicion.</p>

<p>In the mean while, the Eastern Ghilzyes were breaking
out into revolt.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> They had the same cause of complaint
as the Kohistanees. The money-bag, which had kept
them in order, was beginning to fail. It is a moot point
whether revenge or avarice is the stronger feeling in the
Afghan breast. Both were now arrayed against us. The
bayonet and the money-bag were failing to do their
work.</p>

<p>The expenses of the occupation of Afghanistan had long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
been telling fearfully upon the revenues of India. Lord
Auckland had been slow to look the intolerable evil of
this exhausting drain fairly in the face. But the other
members of the Supreme Council had been less slow to
address themselves fully to the subject; and the home
authorities had written out urgent letters regarding the
miserable results of the continued occupation of a country
that yielded nothing but strife. Looking at the matter
in the most favourable point of view, it was found that
the support of Shah Soojah cost the treasury of India
at least a million and a quarter a year. The Board of
Control, or that fusion of the two authorities of the
crown and the company, known as the Secret Committee,
had taken, at the close of 1840, a correct and statesmanlike
view of the subject, and had written out, that they
could see nothing in the continued support of Shah
Soojah, who, it was plain, had no hold upon the affections
of the people, to compensate for this alarming exhaustion
of the financial resources of India, and the necessary
injuries inflicted upon the people by such a fearful waste
of the revenues of the country.</p>

<p>On the last day of the year they had clearly and emphatically
propounded their views of this important question,
saying;&mdash;“We pronounce our decided opinion that for
many years to come, the restored monarchy will have need
of a British force, in order to maintain peace in its own
territory, and prevent aggression from without. We must
add, that to attempt to accomplish this by a small force,
or by the mere influence of British Residents, will, in our
opinion, be most unwise and frivolous, and that we should
prefer the entire abandonment of the country, and a frank
confession of complete failure, to any such policy. Even
financial considerations justify this view, inasmuch as a
strong and adequate military establishment, costly as it
must be, will hardly entail so much expense upon you as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
those repeated revolts and disorders which must arise in
an ill-governed, half-subdued country; and which will
compel you to make great and sudden efforts to maintain
your character, and recover predominance. To whatever
quarter we direct our attention, we behold the restored
monarchy menaced by dangers, which cannot possibly be
encountered by the military means at the disposal of the
minister at the Court of Shah Soojah, and we again desire
you seriously to consider which of the two alternatives (a
speedy retreat from Afghanistan, or a considerable increase
of the military force in that country), you may feel it your
duty to adopt. We are convinced that you have no middle
course to pursue with safety and with honour.” The
letter enunciating these views had been scarcely signed
when intelligence of the surrender of Dost Mahomed was
received in England. But these tidings had caused no
change in the opinions of the Secret Committee, and on
the 2nd of January, 1841, they had written again to the
Supreme Government, saying, “The surrender of Dost
Mahomed does not alter the views contained in our late
letters, and we hope that advantage will be taken of it to
settle affairs in Afghanistan according to those views.”</p>

<p>When these letters reached Calcutta, in the spring of
1841, it had become a matter for the serious consideration
of the Indian Government, whether the policy, which had
proved so utterly disastrous, should not be openly and
boldly abandoned. The question came before the Supreme
Council at the end of March.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Either by some negligence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
or by some juggle, the opinions of the military
members of Council were not obtained. Lord Auckland
and the civilians decided in favour of the continued
occupation of the country, though it was certain that it
could only be done at the cost of a million and a quarter
a year. But money had already become painfully scarce.
It was necessary to recruit the exhausted treasury. There
was no other mode of accomplishing this than by opening
a new loan. Such a public declaration of the embarrassed
condition of the government was distressing to Lord Auckland;
but nothing else was to be done. So at the end of
March he drew up an advertisement for a five per cent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
loan.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> It is a remarkable instance of that kind of monomaniac
blindness which besets some men, under peculiar
conditions of existence, that when Macnaghten learned that
a new loan had been opened, he asked, “What can this
be for?” and spoke of the war&mdash;<i>in China</i>?<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>But the call was responded to but slowly.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Money did
not come in freely, though it was going out with a freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
perhaps unexampled in the history of Indian finance; and
the home authorities still continued to write out, as Sir
Jasper Nicolls and others in India were declaring, that it
had become necessary either to withdraw altogether from
Afghanistan, or to fall back upon the alternative of a large
augmentation of the army. As the year advanced, too,
other influences were at work to move the Indian Government
to consider more and more intently the subject of
the continued drain upon the resources of India. Great
Britain was on the eve of a change of ministry, which
would settle in Downing-street a party of Conservative
statesmen, and send to Calcutta one of their number,
known to be hostile to the whole policy of the expedition
across the Indus; and Macnaghten was already beginning
to tremble at the thought of what he called prospectively
an “unparalleled atrocity”&mdash;but what many would have
regarded as an act of wisdom and justice&mdash;the withdrawal
of the British army from Afghanistan. How strongly the
Envoy felt upon this subject, and in what manner he
argued against it, may be gathered from a letter which, on
the 25th of September, he addressed to the Governor of
Agra. Still he continued to report that the whole country
was quiet, and insisted that the Shah’s force, aided by one
European regiment at Caubul, and another at Candahar,
would be sufficient to keep the whole country in order:</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><span class="ls1">......</span>Rumours are rife as to the intentions of the
Tories towards this country, when they get into power. If they
deprive the Shah altogether of our support, I have no hesitation
in saying (and that is saying a great deal) they will commit an unparalleled
political atrocity. The consequences would be frightful.
The act would not only involve a positive breach of treaty, but it
would be a cheat of the first magnitude. Had we left Shah Soojah
alone, after seating him on the throne, the case would have been
different. He would have adopted the Afghan method of securing
his sovereignty. But we insisted upon his acting according to
European notions of policy, and we have left all his enemies intact&mdash;powerless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
only because we are here. In short, we should leave
him with all the odium of having called in the aid of foreign infidel
auxiliaries, and with none of those safeguards which he himself
would have provided for his security. How could we expect him,
under such circumstances, to maintain his power? I know that he
would not attempt it. He would pack up his all, and return to his
asylum in India, the moment our resolution was imparted to him.
We have effectually prevented his forming a party for himself. In
a few years hence, when the present generation of turbulent intriguers
shall have been swept away, the task will be comparatively
easy. As it is, the progress we have made towards pacifying, or
rather subjugating (for neither the Douranees nor the Ghilzyes were
ever before <i>subject</i> to a monarchy), is perfectly wonderful. The
Douranee Kings kept these unruly tribes in good humour by leading
them to foreign conquest. The Barukzye rulers kept them
down by sharing their power with some, and sowing dissensions
amongst others, by the most paltry and unjustifiable shifts and
expedients, to which the Shah could not, if it were in his nature
even, have recourse. Now the whole country is as quiet as one of
our Indian chiefships, and more so&mdash;but the reaction would be
tremendous if the weight of our power was suddenly taken off.
There are gangs of robbers here and there which it would be desirable
to extirpate; and I had intended to postpone this job till a
more favourable opportunity; but you will see, from my official
letters, that it has been forced upon me, by Captain Hay’s proceedings,
at an earlier period than I anticipated. We are well prepared,
however, and the coercion of these brigands will have an excellent
effect all over the country. Dost Mahomed not only tolerated
them, but went snacks in their spoils. After their dispersion shall
have been effected, there will be literally nothing to do except the
subjugation of Nijrow. Pottinger has a project for effecting this,
without trouble or expense, by marching through their country the
troops returning to Hindostan and Jellalabad. I have submitted
this to the General; and should it be carried into effect, I shall beg
of government to send us no more troops, for they would only be
an incumbrance. A million and a quarter per annum is certainly
an awful outlay; but if the items were examined, you would find
that a full moiety of this is to be laid to the account of Mr. Bell’s
proceedings in Upper Sindh, where they have had an army, <i>cui
bono?</i> larger than the Army of the Indus. All this profligate
expenditure will now cease, and, barring Herat, I am quite certain
that the Shah’s force would be ample, with the addition of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
European regiment at Caubul and another at Candahar, to keep the
entire country in order. I am, too, making great reduction in our
political expenditure; and I feel certain that, in a very short time,
an outlay of thirty lakhs per annum will cover, and more than
cover, all our expenses. The process of macadamization (which,
notwithstanding the present lull, I cannot but consider as near at
hand) would reduce our outlay to nothing. I should not be surprised
to see Colonel Stoddart and Arthur Conolly walking in any
fine morning. I am glad you approved of the wig I conveyed to
the latter. I am satisfied it adverted from him worse consequences.
His enthusiasm, which I found it impossible to repress, is continually
leading him into scrapes<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a><span class="ls1">....</span></p>

<p class="p1">Such, at the close of September, were Macnaghten’s
views of our continued occupation of Afghanistan. But,
before this, the letters of the Secret Committee, the orders
of the Supreme Government, and the portentous shadow
of the coming Tory ministry, had roused Macnaghten to a
sense of the great fact, that it was necessary to do something
to render less startlingly and offensively conspicuous
the drain upon the resources of India, which was exhausting
the country, and paralysing the energies of its rulers.
So it was determined to carry into effect a system of
economy, to be applied, wherever it could be applied, to the
expenditure of Afghanistan; and, as ordinarily happens,
both in the concerns of public and of private life, the
retrenchments which were first instituted were those which
ought to have been last. Acting in accordance with the
known wishes of government, Macnaghten began to retrench
the stipends, or subsidies, paid to the chiefs. He
knew how distasteful the measure would be; he was
apprehensive of its results. But money was wanted, and
he was compelled to give it effect.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The blow fell upon all the chiefs about the capital&mdash;upon
the Ghilzyes, upon the Kohistanees, upon the
Caubulees, upon the Momunds, even upon the Kuzzilbashes.
Peaceful remonstrance was in vain. So they
held secret meetings, and entered into a confederacy to
overawe the existing government, binding themselves by
oaths to support each other in their efforts to recover what
they had lost; or, failing in this, to subvert the system
out of which these injurious proceedings had arisen.
Foremost in this movement were the Eastern Ghilzyes.
Affected by the general retrenchments, they had also
particular grievances of their own.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> They were the first,
therefore, to throw off the mask. So they quitted Caubul&mdash;occupied
the passes on the road to Jellalabad&mdash;plundered
a valuable cafila&mdash;and entirely cut off our communications
with the provinces of Hindostan.</p>

<p>Upon this, Humza Khan, the governor of the Ghilzyes,
was sent out to bring them back to their allegiance.
“Humza Khan,” wrote Macnaghten to Macgregor, on the
2nd of October, “who is at the bottom of the whole
conspiracy, has been sent out by his Majesty to bring back
the Ghilzye chiefs who have fled; but I have little hope of
the success of his mission.”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Humza Khan, whose own
stipend was included in the general retrenchment, had
been commissioned to carry the obnoxious measure into
effect; and he had instigated the chiefs to resist it. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
was now sent out to quell a disturbance of which he was
himself the parent and the nurse.</p>

<p>These movements did not at first much alarm Macnaghten.
He was intent upon his departure from Caubul;
and he said that the outbreak had happened at a fortunate
moment, as his own party and the troops proceeding to
the provinces could quell it on their way to India. “You
will have heard ere now,” he wrote on the 3rd of October,
to Major Rawlinson, “of my appointment to Bombay. I
could wish that this most honourable distinction had been
withheld a little longer, until I could have pronounced our
relations in this country as being entirely satisfactory;
but, thanks in a great measure to your zealous co-operation,
I may even now say, that every thing is rapidly
verging to that happy consummation. No time is fixed
for my departure. That will depend upon the instructions
I receive from Lord Auckland. Should his Lordship
direct me to deliver over my charge to Burnes, there is
little or nothing, that I know of, to detain me, and I ought
to be in Bombay by the middle of December. I am suffering
a little anxiety just now, as the Eastern Ghilzye chiefs
have turned <i>Yaghee</i>, in consequence, I believe, of the
reduction of their allowances, and their being required to
sign an ittezain against robberies. We have sent to bring
them back to their allegiance, and I think there will be no
difficulty about them, unless the root of the <i>Fussad</i> lies
deeper, and they are, as some assert, in league with
Mahomed Akbar. In that case, it will be necessary to
undertake operations on a larger scale against Nijrow and
Tugao, in the latter of which districts the Moofsids (rebels)
have taken refuge. They are very kind in breaking out
just at the moment most opportune for our purposes. The
troops will take them <i>en route</i> to India. To-morrow I hope
our expedition will reach the refractory forts of Zao, and
teach them a most salutary lesson.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>But after a few days, he began to take a more serious
view of the matter; and he urged Macgregor to return
with all despatch to Caubul, that he might accompany the
expedition he was about to send out against the rebels.
But at the same time he wrote to Rawlinson, that he did
not apprehend any open opposition; and he never seemed
to doubt that the insurrectionary movement would
promptly be put down.</p>

<p>Sale’s brigade, which was returning to the provinces, was,
it has been seen, to stifle the insurrection <i>en route</i> to Jellalabad.
Macnaghten, however, thought of strengthening the
force, with a view to the operations against the Ghilzyes,
and he wrote to Captain Trevor, who, pending the arrival
of Macgregor, was holding the enemy in negotiation, that
he believed the General would send out “two eight-inch
mortars, two iron nine-pounder guns, Abbott’s battery,
the 5th Cavalry, the Sappers and Miners, and the 13th
Queen’s, with the 35th and 37th Native Infantry.”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> But
he continued to talk of the “impudence of the rascals,”
and expressed his belief that, the insurrection put down,
the country would be quieter than ever.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> On the 9th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
October, Colonel Monteith marched from Caubul, with the
35th Native Infantry, a squadron of the 5th Cavalry, two
guns of Abbott’s battery under Dawes, and Broadfoot’s
Sappers and Miners. That night his camp was attacked
at Bootkhak&mdash;the first march on the Jellalabad road. On
the 10th, therefore, Sale received orders to march at once
with the 13th Light Infantry, and on the following day he
started to clear the passes. On the 12th, he entered the
defile of Khoord-Caubul. The enemy occupied the heights
in considerable force, and, in their own peculiar style of
warfare, opened a galling fire upon our advancing column.
Sale was wounded at the first onset, and Dennie took
command of the troops. He spoke with admiration of
“the fearless manner in which the men of the 13th, chiefly
young soldiers, ascended heights nearly perpendicular
under the sharp fire of the insurgents;” and added, that
the Sepoys of the 35th, who had fought under him at
Bameean, “rivalled and equalled them in steadiness,
activity, and intrepidity.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The pass was cleared, and
then the 13th retraced its steps to Bootkhak, whilst
Monteith, with the 35th and the other details, was left
encamped in the Khoord-Caubul valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mean while, Macgregor had returned from the
Zoormut country. The Envoy had known him long, and
had abundant confidence in the man. An officer of the
Bengal Artillery, who had been a favourite member of
Lord Auckland’s personal staff, he had accompanied Macnaghten
to Lahore and Loodhianah, on the mission to
negotiate the Tripartite treaty, and had subsequently been
employed in political superintendence of the country
between Caubul and Jellalabad, where, by an admirable
union of the vigorous and the conciliatory in his treatment
of the tribes, he had won both their respect and
their affection. The Envoy now believed that Macgregor
would soon restore the country to tranquillity, and was
impatient until his return. Macgregor reached Caubul on
the 11th of October, and soon started for Monteith’s camp.
Macnaghten, who believed that the outbreak was local and
accidental, looked with eagerness to the result. He took
little heed of what was going on in the Kohistan. Nor
did he think that the Douranee Khans, whose “noses he
had brought to the grindstone,” were plotting their emancipation
from the thraldom of the infidels.</p>

<p>But Pottinger, in the Kohistan, plainly saw the storm
that was brewing&mdash;plainly saw the dangers and difficulties
by which he was surrounded. As the month of
October advanced, the attitude of the Kohistanees and the
Nijrowees was more and more threatening. Meer Musjedee,
the Nijrow chief, a man of a resentful and implacable
temper, had been, some time before, described in the newspaper
paragraphs of the day as stalking about the country,
and sowing broadcast the seeds of rebellion. The measures
of the King’s government had long before made these very
people, who had risen up against the tyranny of Dost
Mahomed, ripe for revolt against the more consummate
tyranny of the Shah. And now, in the middle of October,
Pottinger saw that the state of things was fast approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
a crisis; so he demanded hostages from the Kohistanee
chiefs. To this the Envoy reluctantly consented. “And,”
wrote Pottinger, in his official account of these transactions,
“I only succeeded in procuring them by the end of
the month, when everything betokened a speedy rupture
with the Nijrowees.” By this time, indeed, Meer Musjedee
had openly raised the standard of revolt, and the
people were clustering around it.</p>

<p>Macnaghten thought very lightly of these movements
in the Kohistan. Nothing disturbed his faith in the
general tranquillity of the country, and the popularity of
the double government. He greatly desired the settlement
of the Ghilzye question, for there was something palpable
and undeniable in such a movement; and he was anxious
to set his face towards the provinces of Hindostan.
Eagerly, therefore, he looked for intelligence from Macgregor.
He had begun, however, to doubt whether so
troublesome a business could be settled by peaceful negotiation.
“We must thresh the rascals, I fear, after all,”
he wrote to Macgregor, on the 17th; “but I don’t think
that the troops will be under weigh until the 20th. Is
not this provoking? Abbott has made some excuse about
his guns being injured. Pray write a circumstantial plan
of the best means of surrounding and preventing the
escape of the villains.”<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Abbott was not a man to make
excuses of any kind, but the Envoy was becoming impatient.
On the 18th, he wrote again: “It has been determined
that the Sappers and Miners, the mountain train, and
two companies of the 37th Native Infantry, march out to
join you to-morrow morning. They will make one march
to Khoord-Caubul. The next day I hope you will be
joined by the 13th, the 37th, and Abbott’s battery. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
hope you will arrange the plan of attack before Sale
arrives.”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> But although Macnaghten was eager to
“thresh the rascals,” certain prudential considerations
suggested to him that it would only be expedient to punish
them as much as could “conveniently” be done. It would
not be convenient, at such a time, to exasperate the insurgents
too much, and drive them to block up the passes,
and plunder everything that came in their way.</p>

<p>In the mean while, Monteith, in his isolated post in the
Khoord-Caubul valley, was exposed, if not to some danger,
to considerable inconvenience, for the enemy made a night-attack
upon his camp, aided by the treachery of the
Afghan horsemen, under the Shah’s Meer Akhor, (or
Master of the Horse) who admitted the rebels within their
lines. One of our officers, Lieutenant Jenkins, and several
Sepoys, were killed; and a number of camels carried off
by the enemy. Monteith reported the treachery of his
Afghan friends, and the Envoy resented his just suspicions.
But he was now to be relieved. Sale appeared with two
more infantry regiments, with more guns, and more sabres;
and after a brief halt, for want of carriage, which much
tried the patience of the Envoy, the whole swept on to
Tezeen. Here the force halted for some days, and Macgregor
busied himself in negotiations with the enemy.
Macnaghten had instructed him to accommodate matters,
if it could be done without any loss of honour; and Macgregor
was candid enough to acknowledge that the insurrection
of the Ghilzyes had been brought about by “harsh
and unjust” measures of our own. So he opened a
communication with the rebel chiefs; and, being known
to most of them, consented to a personal interview. So
Macgregor met the chiefs. There was a long and animated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
discussion. They demanded that their salaries should be
restored to their former footing, and that they should not
be held responsible for robberies committed beyond their
respective boundaries. To these demands Macgregor consented.
But they demanded also that Shool Mahomed,
who had been removed, as a rebel, from the chiefship of
their tribe, should be re-instated; and this point Macgregor
resolutely refused to concede, in the belief that
such concession would compromise the honour of the
Government. The chiefs yielded, and Macgregor returned
to camp. It was supposed that the Ghilzye affair had
been “patched up after a fashion;” not, perhaps, without
some loss of dignity, but with as much vigour as was
convenient at the time. The chiefs sent in their agents to
remain with Macgregor, ostensibly to aid him in the
re-establishment of the police, and post stations on the
road; and Macnaghten was able to report that the affair
was settled.</p>

<p>He thought, however, that the terms granted to the
rebels were too favourable; and the King was dissatisfied
with them; but the Envoy replied that it was the treachery
of the Shah’s own people that had paralysed the efforts of
our negotiators. Indeed, it was known that people about
the Court had left Caubul for the purpose of joining in
a night-attack upon our troops. Still Macnaghten could
not believe that there was any wide-spread feeling of disaffection
among the chiefs and the people of Caubul; nor
when Pottinger sent in gloomy reports from the Kohistan,
could he bring himself to think that they were anything
but the creations of a too excitable brain. “Pottinger
writes,” he said,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> “as if he were about to be invaded by
the Nijrowees, but I imagine that there is little ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
for this alarm, and that at all events the fellows will
sneak into their holes again when they hear that the
Ghilzyes are quiet.” This was written on the 26th of
October. On the 29th he wrote again, saying, “I trust
I have at last got Pottinger into a pacific mood, though I
tremble when I open any of his letters, lest I should find
that he has got to loggerheads with some of his neighbours.
In the present excited state of men’s minds, a row in any
quarter would be widely infectious, and we are not in a
condition to stand much baiting.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Macgregor had learnt the value of his treaty.
From Tezeen to Gundamuck the agents of the Ghilzye
chiefs were in our camp; but there was some hard fighting
for the brigade. The enemy mustered in force, and
attacked our column; and the old excuse was made, that
it was owing to no faithlessness on the part of the chiefs,
but to their inability to control the tribes. It was a
terrible country for a baggage-encumbered force to toil
through, in the face of an active enemy. Jugdulluck was
gained with little opposition; but, on the next march, it
was seen that the heights were bristling with armed men,
and a heavy fire was poured in from all the salient
points, on which, with the instincts of the mountaineer,
they had posted themselves, with such terrible effect.
Sale threw out his flanking parties, and the light troops,
skirmishing well up the hill sides, dislodged the enemy,
whilst a party under Captain Wilkinson, pushing
through the defile, found that the main outlet had not
been guarded, and that the passage was clear. The
march was resumed; but the enemy were not yet weary
of the contest. Reappearing in great numbers, they fell
furiously upon our rear-guard, and, for a time, our
people, thus suddenly assailed, were in a state of terrible
disorder. The energetic efforts of our officers brought
back our men to a sense of their duty, and restored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the confidence, which, for a little space, had forsaken the
young soldiers. Broadfoot, Backhouse, and Fenwick, are
said to have rallied and re-animated them. But the
loss that fell upon them was heavy&mdash;more than a hundred
men were killed and wounded; and among them was
Captain Wyndham, of the 35th, who fell like a brave
soldier in the unequal fight.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Sale halted at Gundamuck. Macnaghten heard of the
loss sustained between Jugdulluck and Soorkhab, but
wrote to Macgregor, on the 1st of November, that he
“hoped the business last reported was the expiring
effort of the rebels;” and that the party would have
dispersed, and thannahs been re-established. To Major
Rawlinson he wrote on the same day, and congratulated
him on the tranquil appearance that affairs had assumed
in the direction of Candahar. It was now the very day
that he had fixed upon for his departure from Caubul;
and still he did not doubt for a moment that his emancipation
was close at hand.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">[November-1841.]</p>

<p class="pch">The Outbreak at Caubul&mdash;Approaching Departure of the Envoy&mdash;Immediate
Causes of the Rebellion&mdash;Death of Sir Alexander Burnes&mdash;His
Character&mdash;Spread of the Insurrection&mdash;Indecision of the
British Authorities.</p>

<p><span class="beg">Brightly</span> and cheerfully the month of November
dawned upon the retiring envoy and his successor.
Macnaghten was about to lay down the reins of office,
and turn his face, in a day or two, towards Bombay.
Burnes, rejoicing in the thought of being “supreme at
last” (but somewhat disquieted by the silence of government
on the subject), was stretching out his hand to
receive the prize he had so long coveted. The one was
as eager to depart as the other to see the departure of his
chief; and both were profoundly impressed with the conviction
that the great administrative change was about to
be effected under an unclouded sky.</p>

<p>There were others, however, who viewed with different
eyes the portents that were gathering around them&mdash;others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
who warned the envoy and Burnes of the dangers
of such a confederacy as had been formed against the
British in Afghanistan. Among these was Captain Colin
Mackenzie, an officer of the Madras army, whose enquiring
and adventurous spirit had prompted him to seek
service in Afghanistan, and who had soon recommended
himself to the Envoy by his intelligence and high
character for political employment. He told Macnaghten
at the end of October that Akbar Khan, the ablest and
most determined of Dost Mahomed’s sons, had arrived at
Bameean from Bokhara, and that he surely meditated
mischief. But the envoy only replied that if it were so,
Oosman Khan, the Wuzeer, would have known and
reported the circumstance to him. About the same time,
Lieutenant John Conolly, a young relative of Macnaghten,
and a member of his personal staff, told him that a rising
in the city was meditated, and that the shopkeepers knew
so well what was coming, that they refused to sell their
goods to our people lest they should be murdered for
favouring the Feringhees.</p>

<p>Among these, also, was Mohun Lal. Before the arrival
of Captain Macgregor from the Zoormut country, he had
been deputed to accompany General Sale’s camp, and on
his return to Caubul, he had laid the result of his observations,
whilst on that expedition, before Sir Alexander
Burnes. Entering fully upon the nature and extent of
the confederacy, the Moonshee emphatically declared his
opinion that it would be dangerous to disregard such
threatening indications of a coming storm, and that if the
conspiracy were not crushed in its infancy, it would become
too strong to be easily suppressed. Burnes replied
that the day had not arrived for his interference&mdash;that he
could not meddle with the arrangements of the Envoy;
but that Macnaghten would shortly turn his back upon
Caubul, and that measures should then be taken to conciliate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the Ghilzyes and Kohistanees, by raising their
allowances again to the point from which they had been
reduced. On the 1st of November, Mohun Lal again
pressed the subject of the hostile confederacy upon the
expectant minister. Burnes stood up from his chair,
and said, with a sigh, that the time had come for the
British to leave the country;<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> but, on the same evening,
he congratulated Sir William Macnaghten on his approaching
departure at a period of such profound tranquillity.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>On that very evening the hostile chiefs met and determined,
in conclave, upon the measures to be taken for
the overthrow of the British power in Afghanistan. To
rouse the people into action by a skilful use of the king’s
name, seemed to be the safest course of procedure. But
doubts arose as to whether it were wiser to enlist the
loyal sympathies of his subjects, or to excite their indignation
against him. It might be announced, on the one
hand, that the King had given orders for the destruction
of the infidels; or a report might be spread that he had
declared his intention of seizing the principal chiefs, and
sending them prisoners to London. It would seem that
the rebels did both; and at the same time lulled the
suspicions of the Envoy by frequent visits to his house,
and loud assurances of friendship. Abdoollah Khan,
Achekzye, announced the certainty of their expatriation
in a letter to the principal Sirdars, whilst the other object
was accomplished by forging the King’s seal to a document,
ordering the destruction of the Feringhees, or
rather, forging the document to the seal.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Men of
different tribes and conflicting interests had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
common cause against the Feringhees. Barukzye, Populzye,
Achekzye, and Ghilzye chiefs were all banded
together. Why they should have fixed upon that particular
2nd of November for the first open demonstration
at Caubul it is not easy to conjecture. To have waited
a few days would have been to have waited for the
departure of the Envoy, of the General, and of a considerable
body of troops from Afghanistan. The supposition,
indeed, is, that however widely spread the
disaffection, and however extensive the confederacy, the
first outbreak was not the result of any general organisation,
but was the movement only of a section of the
national party. It was too insignificant in itself, and
there was too little evidence of design in it, to have
sprung out of any matured plan of action on the part of
a powerful confederacy. What that confederacy was may
be gathered from Macnaghten’s admission, that when,
early in December, he met the Afghan leaders at a
conference, he saw assembled before him the heads of
nearly all the chief tribes in the country.</p>

<p>The meeting on the night of the 1st of November was
held at the house of Sydat Khan, Alekozye. Foremost
among the chiefs there assembled was Abdoollah Khan.
By nature proud, cruel, and vindictive, this man was
smarting under a sense of injuries inflicted upon him by
the restored Suddozye government, and of insults received
from one of Shah Soojah’s British allies. On the
restoration of the King, Abdoollah Khan had been dispossessed
of the chiefship of his tribe, and had ever since
been retained about the Court, rather as a hostage than
as a recognised officer of the government. Ever ready
to promote disaffection and encourage revolt, he had
seen with delight the rising of the Ghilzyes, and during
their occupation of the passes had been eagerly intriguing
with the chiefs. Aware of Abdoollah Khan’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
designs, Burnes sent him an angry message&mdash;called him
a dog&mdash;and threatened to recommend Shah Soojah to
deprive the rebel of his ears. When the chiefs met
together on the night of the 1st of November, this
indignity was rankling in the breast of the Khan. The
immediate course to be pursued came under discussion,
and he at once proposed that the first overt act of
violence on the morrow should be an attack on the house
of the man who had so insulted him. The proposal
was accepted by the assembled chiefs; but so little did
they anticipate more than a burst of success at the outset,
that not one of them ventured personally to take part
in a movement which they believed would be promptly
avenged.</p>

<p>Day had scarcely dawned on the 2nd of November,
when a rumour reached the cantonments, and was at once
conveyed to the Mission-house, that there was a commotion
in the city. John Conolly, who was to have
accompanied him to Bombay, was giving directions about
the packing of some of the Envoy’s chattels, when an
Afghan rushed wildly in, and announced that there was
an insurrection in the city. Conolly went out immediately,
heard the firing in the streets, and hastened to
convey the intelligence to Macnaghten.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The Envoy received
it with composure. There was nothing in it, he
thought, to startle or to dismay a man with sound nerves
and a clear understanding. Presently a note was brought
him from Burnes. It stated that there was great excitement
in the city, especially in the neighbourhood of his
residence; but it spoke slightingly of the disturbance, and
said that it would speedily be suppressed. Assistance,
however, was sought. Burnes wanted military support;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and Macnaghten, still little alarmed by the tidings that
had reached him, hurried to the quarters of the General.
It was thought to be only a slight commotion. And so it
was&mdash;at the outset. But before any assistance was sent
to Burnes, he had been cut to pieces by an infuriated
mob.</p>

<p>The houses of Sir Alexander Burnes and of Captain
Johnson, the paymaster of the Shah’s troops, were contiguous
to each other in the city. On the preceding
night, Captain Johnson had slept in cantonments. The
expectant Resident was at home. Beneath his roof was
his brother, Lieutenant Charles Burnes; and Lieutenant
William Broadfoot, an officer of rare merit, who had
been selected to fill the office of military secretary to the
minister elect, and had just come in from Charekur to
enter upon his new duties. It was now the anniversary
of the day on which his brother had been slain by Dost
Mahomed’s troopers, in the disastrous affair of Purwundurrah;
and it must have been with some melancholy
recollections of the past, and some dismal forebodings of
the future, that he now looked down from the upper gallery
of Burnes’s house, upon the angry crowd that was
gathering beneath it.</p>

<p>Before daylight on that disastrous morning a friendly
Afghan sought admittance to Burnes’s house, eager to
warn him of the danger with which he was encompassed.
A plot had been hatched on the preceding night; and
one of its first objects was said to be the assassination of
the new Resident. But Burnes had nothing but incredulity
to return to such friendly warnings. The man went.
The insurgents were gathering. Then came Oosman
Khan, the Wuzeer, crossing Burnes’s threshold, with the
same ominous story on his lips. It was no longer permitted
to the English officer to wrap himself up in an
impenetrable cloak of scepticism. Already was there a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
stir in the streets. Already was an excited populace
assembling beneath his windows. Earnestly the Afghan
minister spoke of the danger, and implored Burnes to
leave his house, to accompany him to the Balla Hissar,
or to seek safety in cantonments. The Englishman, deaf
to these appeals, confident that he could quell the tumult,
and scorning the idea of quitting his post, rejected the
friendly counsel of the Wuzeer, and remained to face the
fury of the mob.</p>

<p>But even to Alexander Burnes, incredulous of imminent
danger as he was, it seemed necessary to do something.
He wrote to the Envoy, calling for support.
And he sent messengers to Abdoollah Khan. Two
chuprassies were despatched to the Achekzye chief, assuring
him that if he would restrain the populace from
violence, every effort would be made to adjust the
grievances complained of by the people and the chiefs.
One only of the messengers returned. He brought back
nothing but wounds. The message had cost the other
his life.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, from a gallery in the upper part of
his house, Burnes was haranguing the mob. Beside him
were his brother and his friend. The crowd before his
house increased in number and in fury. Some were
thirsting for blood; others were greedy only for plunder.
He might as well have addressed himself to a herd of
savage beasts. Angry voices were lifted up in reply,
clamoring for the lives of the English officers. And
too surely did they gain the object of their desires.
Broadfoot, who sold his life dearly, was the first to fall.
A ball struck him on the chest; and the dogs of the city
devoured his remains.</p>

<p>It was obvious now that nothing was to be done by
expostulation; nothing by forbearance. The violence of
the mob was increasing. That which at first had been an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
insignificant crowd had now become a great multitude.
The treasury of the Shah’s paymaster was before them;
and hundreds who had no wrongs to redress and no
political animosity to vent, rushed to the spot, hungering
after the spoil which lay so temptingly at hand. The
streets were waving with a sea of heads; and the opposite
houses were alive with people. It was no longer possible
to look unappalled upon that fearful assemblage. A party
of the insurgents had set fire to Burnes’s stables;<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> had
forced their way into his garden; and were calling to him
to come down. His heart now sank within him. He saw
clearly the danger that beset him&mdash;saw that the looked-for
aid from the cantonment had failed him in the hour of
his need. Nothing now was left to him, but to appeal
to the avarice of his assailants. He offered them large
sums of money, if they would only spare his own and his
brother’s life. Their answer was a repetition of the summons
to “come down to the garden.” Charles Burnes and
a party of chuprassies were, at this time, firing on the mob.
A Mussulman Cashmerian, who had entered the house,
swore by the Koran that if they would cease firing upon
the insurgents, he would convey Burnes and his brother
through the garden in safety to the Kuzzilbash Fort.
Disguising himself in some articles of native attire, Burnes
accompanied the man to the door. He had stepped but a
few paces into the garden, when his conductor called out
with a loud voice, “This is Sekunder Burnes!”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The
infuriated mob fell upon him with frantic energy. A
frenzied moollah dealt the first murderous blow; and in a
minute the work was complete. The brothers were cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to pieces by the Afghan knives.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Naib Sheriff, true to
the last, buried their mutilated remains.</p>

<p>So fell Alexander Burnes. In the vigour of his years&mdash;in
the pride of life&mdash;within a few feet of the goal
which he had long held so steadily in view. It has been
said that he predicted the coming storm; and by others
again that he refused to see it. He may have warned
others; but he rejected all warning himself. It was only
in keeping with the character of the man that he should
have been subject to such fluctuations of feeling and
opinion. Sometimes sanguine; sometimes desponding&mdash;sometimes
confident; sometimes credulous&mdash;he gave to
fleeting impressions all the importance and seeming permanency
of settled convictions, and imbued surrounding
objects with the colours of his own varying mind. At
one time, he could discern with intuitive sagacity the
hidden dangers besetting our position in Afghanistan,
and illustrate his views with an impressive earnestness
which caused him to be regarded by his official superior
as a wildly speculative alarmist. At another, when
destruction was impending over his head&mdash;when the
weapon was sharpened to immolate him&mdash;he saw nothing
but security and peace; and turned away from the warnings
of those who would have saved him, with an incredulous
smile upon his lips. This instability was a grievous
fault; and grievously he answered it. But though unstable,
he was not insincere. If he deceived others, he
first of all deceived himself. If he gave utterance to
conflicting opinions, they were all <i>his</i> opinions at the time
of their birth. He was a man of an eager impulsive
temperament; the slightest vicissitudes of the political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
atmosphere readily affected his mercurial nature; and he
did not always think before he spoke. Hence it is that
such varying opinions have been attributed to him&mdash;all
perhaps with equal truth. A passing cloud, or a transient
gleam of sunshine, and Afghanistan was either in the
throes of a deadly convulsion, or lapped in heavenly repose.</p>

<p>It was the hard fate of Alexander Burnes to be overrated
at the outset and under-rated at the close of his
career. It may be doubted whether justice has yet been
rendered him&mdash;whether, on the one hand, what was
innately and intrinsically good in him has been amply
recognised, and whether on the other, the accidental
circumstances of his position have been sufficiently taken
into account. From the very commencement of the
Afghan expedition Burnes was placed in a situation calculated
neither to develop the better nor to correct the worse
part of his character. In his own words, indeed, he was in
“the most nondescript of situations.” He had little or no
power. He had no supreme and independent control of
affairs; nor had he, like other political assistants, any
detached employment of a subordinate character; but was
an anomalous appendage to the British mission, looking
out for the chance of succession to the upper seat. In
such a position he felt uneasy and unsettled; he lived
rather in the future than in the present; and chafed under
the reflection that whilst, in all that related to the management
of public affairs, he was an absolute cypher at the
Afghan court, much of the odium of unpopular acts
descended upon him; and that much of the discredit of
failure would attach to him if the measures, which he
was in nowise permitted to shape, were not crowned with
success. There is reason to think that if fairer scope had
been allowed for the display of his abilities, and a larger
amount of responsibility had descended upon him, he
would have shone with a brighter and a steadier light, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
left behind him a still more honourable name. His talents
were great; his energies were great. What he lacked was
stability of character. Power and responsibility would
have steadied him. He would have walked with a firmer
step and in a straighter course under a heavier burden of
political duties. As it was, all the environments of his life
at Caubul were too surely calculated to unhinge and
unbalance even a more steadfast mind. It is right that
all these things should be taken into account. It is right,
too, that it should never be forgotten by those who would
form a correct estimate of the character and career of
Alexander Burnes, that both have been misrepresented in
those collections of state papers which are supposed to
furnish the best materials of history, but which are often
in reality only one-sided compilations of garbled documents&mdash;counterfeits,
which the ministerial stamp forces
into currency, defrauding a present generation and handing
down to posterity a chain of dangerous lies.</p>

<p>Burnes and his companions fell. There was a great
plunder of property. The treasury of Captain Johnson,
the Shah’s paymaster, was sacked. Thirsting for gold,
and thirsting for blood, the insurgents undermined the
walls and burnt the gateway of the house; then falling,
like wild beasts, on all whom they met, and slaughtering
guards and servants&mdash;men, women, and children, alike, in
their indiscriminate fury&mdash;they glutted themselves with
the treasure,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and to complete their work of mischief,
burnt all the records of the office. The noise in the city
was now growing louder and louder. The multitude was
swelling in numbers, and waxing more terrible in excitement
and wrath. But still no measures were taken to
quell the riot or chastise the rioters; no troops were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
poured into the city; no British officer led his battalions
to the charge, or opened upon the enemy with a shower
of unanswerable grape. The escort, at Burnes’s house,
held for some time in painful inactivity by his misplaced
forbearance, had fought with a desperate energy, which,
in the end, cost them their lives; and the guard at the
pay-office, with scarcely less constancy and courage, had
protected their charge until overwhelmed by the rush of
their assailants, and slaughtered almost to a man. What
could these little bands of loyal men do against the surging
multitude that flooded the streets? Emboldened by
impunity, the licentious crowd pushed on to new deeds of
murder and rapine; and soon the whole city was in a roar
of wild tumultuous excitement. Shops were gutted;
houses were burned; men, women, and children, in the
residences of our officers, mixed up in indiscriminate
slaughter;&mdash;and all this with six thousand British troops
within half an hour’s march of the rebellious city.</p>

<p>From the Balla Hissar the King looked down upon the
disturbed city beneath him. But even from that commanding
position little could be seen of what was going on
below in the narrow winding streets, which scarcely presented
more than an expanse of flat house-tops to the
gazers from above. A report had been industriously propagated
that the insurgent movement had been favoured,
if not directed, by the monarch himself; but his conduct
at this moment was not such as to give colour to the
suspicion, which soon began to shape itself in the minds
of his British supporters, and which has not even now
been dislodged. He was agitated, panic-struck, but not
paralysed. The only movement made, on that ill-omened
November morning, to crush the insurrection at its birth,
was made by the King himself. He sent out a regiment
of Hindostanee troops&mdash;that regiment which was still
commanded by the Indo-Briton adventurer Campbell, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
had rendered Shah Soojah good service in his attempt to
expel the Barukzye Sirdars.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Futteh Jung and the
Wuzeer went with them. They moved down with some
spirit upon the city; but shaped their course with such
little wisdom that they were soon in disastrous flight.
They should have moved along the base of the hill to the
outer extremity of the short thoroughfare in which
Burnes’s house was situated. But instead of this they
attempted to make their way through the heart of the
city, and were soon entangled with their guns in its
narrow, intricate streets. Thus embarrassed, they were at
the mercy of the enemy. They lost, it was said, two
hundred of their number,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> were compelled to abandon
their guns, and were soon to be seen hurrying back, a
disorderly rabble, to the shelter of the Balla Hissar.</p>

<p>In the mean while, Brigadier Shelton, with a body of
infantry and artillery, had made his way to the Balla
Hissar, and arrived in time to cover the retreat of Campbell’s
regiment, and to save the guns from the grasp of the
enemy. “Soon after my arrival,” says the Brigadier in
his narrative of these proceedings, “wounded men were
coming in from the city. I was then informed that they
belonged to the King’s Hindostanee Pultun, which his
Majesty had sent into the city with two six-pounders. I
despatched the light company of the 54th N.I. to the gate
of the Balla Hissar leading into the town, and soon after
the remainder of the King’s Pultun and the two guns were
driven in. The latter they were obliged to abandon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
fortunately sufficiently under the wall to enable me to
prevent the enemy from getting possession; but too near
the houses for me to bring them in. I disposed a covering
party accordingly, but on the enemy’s opening his fire,
the Shah’s men rushed back into the gateway, and thus
abandoned the enterprise.” “I mention this,” adds the
Brigadier, “because it was said his Majesty was implicated
in exciting the rebellion&mdash;for in such case he never would
have made so noble an effort, and the only one that was
made to strike at the root.”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>On that day nothing else was done. Deserted by his
personal attendants in the hour of danger, Shah Soojah
seems to have sunk into a pitiable state of dejection and
alarm. The defeat of his Hindostanees had given a
deeper shade to his despondency; he was incapable of
acting for himself or of offering counsel to others, and
all who sought his presence were struck by the anxious
expression of his countenance and the feeble petulance
of his manner. Nothing effective had been done, and
nothing more was to be done at all on that memorable
day&mdash;General Elphinstone had been talking about to-morrow,
when he should have been acting to-day. And
so the evening of the 2nd of November fell upon an
irritable people, established and fortified in resistance by
the indecision of the authorities, against whom they had
erected themselves, and the inactivity of the army by which
they might have been crushed.</p>

<p>It is the common opinion of all competent authorities
that a prompt and vigorous movement, on the morning of
the 2nd of November, would have strangled the insurrection
at its birth. The Afghans freely admitted this. A
Populzye chief who was present at the meeting at Sydat
Khan’s house on the night of the 1st of November, told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Major Rawlinson that not one of the chiefs, who then
leagued themselves together, ventured to stir from his
house until the afternoon of the following day. They
expected that the first onset&mdash;the attack on the houses
of Burnes and Johnson&mdash;would be successful; but they
were under an equally strong conviction that the violence
would be promptly avenged by the troops from cantonments,
and they therefore refrained from committing
themselves by taking any personal part in the <i>émeute</i>.
It seems to have been the impression of the majority that
such an outbreak at the capital would operate as a warning
which the British in Afghanistan would hardly neglect, and
that we should be glad, therefore, to withdraw our forces
in the spring and leave the Douranees to their own
devices.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> “Not only I, but several other officers,” says
Captain Johnson, “have spoken to Afghans on the subject;
there has never been one dissenting voice, that had
a small party gone into the town prior to the plunder of
my treasury and the murder of Burnes, the insurrection
would have been instantly quashed. This was also the
opinion of Captain Trevor, at that time living in the
town.”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Captain Mackenzie has given an equally emphatic
opinion to the same effect. “During our expedition into
Kohistan, under General MacCaskill,” he writes, “I accompanied
it, having been placed by General Pollock in charge
of Shah-zadah Shapoor and the Kuzzilbash camp. In
my frequent communications with Khan Shereen Khan,
some of the late leaders, and other chiefs of the Kuzzilbash
faction, all the circumstances of the late insurrection
were over and over again recapitulated, one and all declaring
positively that the slightest exhibition of energy
on our part, in the first instance, more especially in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
reinforcing my post and that of Trevor, would at once
have decided the Kuzzilbashes, and all over whom they
possessed any influence, in our favour. Khan Shereen
Khan also confirmed the idea that an offensive movement
on the opposite side of the town by Brigadier Shelton,
had it been made in the early part of the fatal 2nd of
November, would at once have crushed the insurrection.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
Mohun Lal says, that in the first instance no more than
thirty men were sent to surround Sir Alexander Burnes’s
house, and that the rest were drawn thither subsequently
by the hope of plunder.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Captain Johnson, already quoted,
adds, “The mob at the first outbreak did not exceed
100 men. They however speedily increased; the plunder
of my treasury, my private property and that of Sir
Alexander&mdash;seeing that no steps were taken to save either
the one or the other, nor even what was of more value to
us at that time, the life of Sir Alexander Burnes&mdash;was too
great a temptation to the inhabitants of Caubul, and when
300 men would have been sufficient in the morning to
have quelled the disturbance, 3000 would not have been
adequate in the afternoon.”<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>The question, then&mdash;and it is one of the gravest that
can be asked in the entire course of this historical inquiry&mdash;is,
how came it that an insurrectionary movement,
which might have been crushed at the outset by a handful
of men, was suffered to grow into a great revolution? It
is a question not to be answered hastily&mdash;not to be
answered at all without the citation of all available evidence.
It is fortunate that at least the facts of the case
are to be ascertained with sufficient distinctness. It is
certain that, on the first receipt of authentic intelligence
of the outbreak in the city, Macnaghten repaired to
Elphinstone’s quarters to seek military aid. Shelton, in
his narrative, says, that much valuable time was lost at
the outset. “The Envoy,” he writes, “must have had
notice by 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, so that much valuable time was, I fear,
lost by remaining quietly at home, receiving reports,
instead of acting promptly and with decision.”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> But the
imputation is not warranted by the real facts of the case.
“On the morning of the 2nd of November”&mdash;such is the
evidence of the Envoy himself&mdash;“I was informed that the
town of Caubul was in a state of commotion; and shortly
afterwards I received a note from Lieutenant-Colonel Sir
A. Burnes, to the effect that his house was besieged, and
begging for assistance. I immediately went to General
Elphinstone.”<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> General Elphinstone himself says: “On
the 2nd of November, at half-past 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, I was told by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Colonel Oliver that the city was in a great ferment, and
shortly after the Envoy came and told me that it was in a
state of insurrection, but that he did not think much of
it, and that it would shortly subside.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Captain Johnson,
too, writes that, on receiving in cantonments intelligence
of the outbreak, he went to report what he had heard to
Captain Lawrence, military secretary to the Envoy. “The
latter,” he adds, “had just received a note from Burnes
on the subject, and was on the way to the General’s.”
Thus it is established that Macnaghten lost no time in
seeking the advice and assistance of the military commander.</p>

<p>Let us next see what was the result of the visit to the
General. “I suggested,” says Macnaghten, “that Brigadier
Shelton’s force should proceed to the Balla Hissar,
thence to operate as might seem expedient; that the
remaining troops should be concentrated in the cantonments,
and placed in a state of defence, and assistance, if
possible, sent to Sir A. Burnes. Before Brigadier Shelton
could reach the Balla Hissar, the town had attained such
a state of ferment that it was deemed impracticable to
penetrate to Sir A. Burnes’s residence, which was in the
centre of the city.”</p>

<p>General Elphinstone’s report is meagre and unsatisfactory,
and does not even allude to any supposed expediency
of supporting Sir Alexander Burnes:&mdash;“It was
proposed,” he says, “that Brigadier Shelton, with two
regiments and guns, should proceed to the Balla Hissar;
and the Envoy sent his military secretary, Captain Lawrence,
to intimate his wishes, and obtain the King’s
sanction to this measure, the Balla Hissar being considered
a commanding position, and the fittest route to
enter the city<span class="ls1">.....</span> The troops, horse artillery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
(four guns), with a company of the 44th Foot, the Shah’s
6th Infantry, and a wing of the 54th N. I., moved under
Brigadier Shelton, about twelve o’clock, into the Balla
Hissar; the rest of the troops were concentrated in
cantonments, which arrangements occupied the rest of
the day.”</p>

<p>Brigadier Shelton’s report is much more explicit and
intelligible. It throws a flood of light on some of the
dark places:&mdash;“On the morning of the 2nd November,”
says the Brigadier, “I passed under the city wall about
seven o’clock, when the cavalry grass-cutters, who were in
the habit of going through the town for their grass, told
me that the city gate was shut, and that they could not
get in. All was quiet at this time; and I rode home,
thinking some robbery might have taken place, and that
the gate might have been shut to prevent the escape of
the thieves. About eight or nine o’clock various reports
were in circulation, and between nine and ten I got a note
from General Elphinstone, reporting a disturbance in the
city, and desiring me to prepare to march into the Balla
Hissar, with three companies 54th N. I., the Shah’s 6th
Infantry, and four guns, all I had in camp (the remainder
of my brigade having been called into cantonments). I
soon after got another, telling me not to go, as the King
objected to it. I replied to this note, that if there was
an insurrection in the city, it was not a moment for indecision,
and recommended him at once to decide upon what
measures he would adopt. The answer to this was, to
march immediately into the Balla Hissar, where I would
receive further instructions from the Envoy’s military
secretary, whom I should find there. Just as I was
marching off, a note came from the latter person to halt
for further orders. I then sent in the engineer officer to
see the cause; but he was cut down by an Afghan, in
dismounting from his horse, just outside the square, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
his Majesty was sitting. Soon after this the secretary
himself came with orders to proceed. I then marched in,
when the King asked me, as well as I could understand,
who sent me, and what I came there for.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>” He was not,
indeed, allowed to operate upon the disturbed city. All
that, circumstanced as he was, Shelton could do, was to
cover the retreat of the Shah’s Hindostanees, who had
been sent out, as we have seen, against the insurgents,
and been disastrously beaten.</p>

<p>It is obvious, therefore, that Brigadier Shelton must be
acquitted of all blame. He recommended, on the morning
of the 2nd of November, prompt and decisive measures,
but he was not empowered to carry them into effect.
The responsibility rests with the Envoy and the General,
and must be equally shared between them. It does not
appear that either recognised the necessity of a prompt
attack upon the disturbed quarter of the city. The
Envoy, always considerate and humane&mdash;sometimes to a
point of weakness&mdash;desired to spare the inhabitants of
Caubul those dreadful scenes of plunder and violence
which ever follow the incursion of a body of retributive
troops into an offending city. But such tender mercies are
often cruel. In such cases the most vigorous measures
are commonly the most humane. It is hard to say how
much human life would have been saved if, early on the
2nd of November, a few companies of infantry and a
couple of guns had been despatched to that portion of the
city where Sir Alexander Burnes and his companions were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
standing at bay before a contemptible rabble, which would
have melted away at the approach of a handful of regular
troops.</p>

<p>Burnes did not believe the outbreak to be a formidable
one; Macnaghten did not believe it to be a formidable
one; and Elphinstone was entirely swayed by the opinions
of his political associates. Hence came the indecision
and inactivity, which were attended with such disastrous
results. Burnes and Macnaghten were right up to a
certain point; but all beyond was lamentably wrong.
The outbreak was not formidable in itself; but it was
certain, in such “ticklish times,”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> very soon to become
formidable. There are seasons when slight indications of
unrest, such as might commonly be disregarded, assume
a portentous and alarming aspect, and demand all the
vigilance and energy of the custodians of the public safety.
Such a season had now arrived; the minds of the people
were in a feverish, inflammable state, and it required very
little to bring on a dangerous paroxysm of irrepressible
violence and disorder. Macnaghten was unwilling to
believe that the chiefs were connected with those October
disturbances which had blocked up the passes between
Caubul and Jellalabad, and thought that the Ghilzye
rising was of a local, accidental character, with which the
Caubulees had no connection, and in which they took no
interest; but Brigadier Shelton has declared his conviction
that the majority of the insurgents who took possession of
the passes were sent out from the city, and that many of
them passed through his camp at Seeah Sungh.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Be this as it may, it is very certain that even an incidental
outbreak in the city of Caubul ought not, at such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>a season, to have been regarded as a matter of light
concern. But an attack upon the residence of a high
political functionary could, in nowise, be looked upon as
an incidental outrage, proceeding neither from political
causes, nor conducing to political results. It was an
emergency, indeed, that called for promptitude of action,
unrestrained either by short-sighted considerations of
humanity or feelings of official delicacy and reserve. Too
anxious to conciliate the wishes of the King, the Envoy
forbore from all aggressive measures until his Majesty had
been consulted; and when he learnt that Campbell’s regiment
had been sent out against the insurgents, he believed
that the insurrection would be speedily put down. But
in such a crisis the British minister might have acted,
without any breach of official rectitude, on his own independent
judgment, and taken upon himself to decide at
once what was best, not only for the King, whom English
money and English arms were supporting on his throne,
but for what was of infinitely more importance, the honour
of the British nation.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand these restraining influences;
but when all due allowance is made for them,
it must still be admitted that at such a time, under such
circumstances, nothing short of a prompt movement upon
the disturbed quarter of the city should have been counselled
by the Envoy and ordered by the General. There
is nothing, indeed, but the impracticability of the movement
that can be urged in extenuation of its neglect.
The Envoy has declared that, by the time Brigadier
Shelton had reached the Balla Hissar, it was impracticable
for a body of troops to penetrate to the neighbourhood of
Burnes’s house. But what was impracticable then was
not impracticable some time before; and Shelton would
have reached the Balla Hissar much sooner, but for the
respect shown to the wishes of the King, the delay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
ascertaining those wishes, and the vacillating orders which
his Majesty thought fit to issue on this momentous
occasion. The attack on the city should have been made
some hours earlier in the day. The movement may have
been impracticable after the hour when Shelton reached
the Balla Hissar; but why was it not made <i>before</i>? The
only point to be decided by the Envoy and the General
was, what body of troops&mdash;whether from Shelton’s camp
or cantonments&mdash;could be most expeditiously despatched
to the disturbed quarter of the town, and most effectually
suppress the disturbance? But instead of directing all
his thoughts to this one great object, the Envoy thought
about the wishes of the Shah and the comforts of the
people; whilst the General, too glad to be saved the
trouble of thinking at all, readily adopted Macnaghten’s
opinions, and believed that the fires which had broken out
in the city might be left to die out by themselves.</p>

<p>Still it must be remembered, on the other hand, that
wise after the event, we are passing sentence on the conduct
of men who had not then the full information which
lights us to a more correct decision; and that if they had
dragooned down the insurrection at the outset, destroying
innocent life and valuable property, they would certainly,
by one party at least, have been impeached as incapable
and dangerous alarmists. It would not improbably have
been said, that they had by a precipitancy, as mischievous
as it was uncalled for, turned friends into enemies, confidence
into mistrust, repose into irritation, and sown broadcast
the seeds of future rebellion over the whole length
and breadth of the land.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">[November, 1841.]</p>

<p class="pch">Progress of the Insurrection&mdash;Attempted Movement on the City&mdash;Attack
on Mahomed Sheriff’s Fort&mdash;Loss of the Commissariat
Fort&mdash;Captain Mackenzie’s Defence&mdash;Capture of Mahomed Sheriff’s
Fort&mdash;Attempts to corrupt the Enemy.</p>


<p><span class="beg">On</span> this disastrous 2nd of November, the British authorities
in the Caubul cantonments, instead of acting to-day,
had, I have said, been talking about doing something
to-morrow. That something was a conjoint movement
from the cantonments and the Balla Hissar on the Lahore
gate of the city. “We must see,” wrote Elphinstone to
Macnaghten, “what the morning brings, and then think
what can be done.” The morning was one of early bustle
and activity throughout the British cantonment. Before
day had broken, the drums beat to arms. Intelligence
had come in that a large body of men were marching over
the Seeah Sungh hills. They were believed to be enemies,
but they proved to be friends. The 37 Regiment of Native
Infantry had been called in from Koord-Caubul on the
preceding day; and it had made good its march, in the
face of no feeble opposition, bringing in its baggage and
its sick in an orderly manner, very creditable to the
commanding officer.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Two guns of the mountain-train
accompanied the regiment. Any addition to the cantonment
force was valuable at such a time; and the 37th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Regiment was regarded as one of the best in the service.
Still, although when our resources were thus increased, a
movement was made upon the city, so small a force was
sent out that it was compelled to retreat.</p>

<p>The movement, such as it was&mdash;the first attempted by
the British troops&mdash;was made three hours after noon. The
enemy had by this time increased mightily in numbers.
Thousands, long ripe for revolt, were now ready to declare
themselves on the side of the national party. All the
surrounding villages poured in their tributaries,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and
swelled the great tide of insurrection. At noon, on the
preceding day, the road between the cantonments and the
city had been scarcely passable; and now all this intervening
ground was alive with an angry enemy. In the
face of a hostile multitude, it was little likely that a weak
detachment could penetrate into the city. The party
sent out on this hazardous service, under Major Swayne,
consisted of one company of H. M.’s 44th Regiment, two
companies of the 5th Native Infantry, and two horse
artillery guns. The whole affair was a failure. The only
fortunate circumstance was that this feeble detachment
retired in good time. Owing to some misconception of
orders, no party had been detached to co-operate with
them from the Balla Hissar; and if they had forced their
way to the Lahore gate of the city, the whole detachment
would have been cut to pieces. As it was, the party was
fired upon from the Kohistan gate, near which it ought
not to have gone;<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and it was soon only too obvious that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a further advance, in the face of such an enemy, would be
a profitless sacrifice of life. Major Swayne brought back
his detachment, and so ended the first attempt to operate
upon the city.</p>

<p>It is hard to say why a stronger force, with a fair allowance
of cavalry, was not sent out in the first instance; or
why, on the return of Swayne’s weak detachment, it was
not re-inforced and sent out against the enemy. There
was daylight enough left to do good execution with an
adequate force, adequately commanded. But the evening
of this day, like that of the preceding one, closed in upon an
inactive and dispirited British force, and an undisciplined
enemy emboldened by impunity and flushed with success.</p>

<p>The aspect of affairs now became more threatening.
Before noon, on the preceding day, the Envoy and his
family had vacated the Residency, and sought a more
secure asylum within the walls of the cantonments. Now
preparations were being made to place those cantonments
in a state of defence. This was no easy matter. The
works were of “frightful extent;” and demanded a much
larger body of troops and greater number of guns, than
were at the disposal of the General, to defend them even
against the “contemptible enemy” that was now collecting
around them. It was not long after the commencement
of the outbreak, before Lieutenant Eyre, the ordnance
commissariat officer, had placed every available gun in
position. But the want of artillery in this conjuncture
was soon lamentably apparent. There had, at no time,
been a sufficiency of this important arm; but one portion
of the miserable allowance was now with Sale’s force,
another in the Balla Hissar, and the wretched remnant
was in cantonments.</p>

<p>It was impossible now any longer to close one’s eyes
against the real state of affairs. They were growing
rapidly worse and worse. The Envoy sate down to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
desk and wrote importunate letters to Captain Macgregor,
urging him to bring back Sir Robert Sale’s force to
Caubul. At the same time he wrote to Candahar, to
arrest the march of the troops that were about to return
to India, and to despatch them with all speed to his relief.
Nothing came of these mandates but disappointment. It
would have been better if the Caubul force had trusted
wholly to itself.</p>

<p>The next day was one of more appalling disaster. It
brought to light a new evil that threatened destruction
to the beleagured force. The commissariat fort&mdash;the
magazine in which all the stores, on which our troops
depended for subsistence, were garnered up&mdash;was outside
the cantonment walls. It was situated about 400 yards
from the south-west bastion of the cantonment. On the
preceding day, the detachment in charge of the fort had
been raised to a subaltern’s guard of eighty men. It was
now threatened by the enemy. Another fort, still nearer
cantonments, known as Mahomed Sheriff’s Fort, was
already in possession of a hostile garrison;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and the
King’s gardens, between which and the cantonments this
fort was situated, were swarming with the insurgents.
The communications between the British cantonments
and the commissariat fort were thus intercepted by the
enemy; and the position of the slender guard posted for
the defence of the latter was therefore one of imminent
peril. The enemy laid siege to the fort; and began to
mine beneath the walls. Surrounded as he was by a far
superior force, and seeing no possibility of repelling the
assaults of the enemy, Lieutenant Warren, who commanded
the guard, officially reported the danger of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
position; and set forth that, unless re-inforced, he should
be obliged to abandon his post. The letter was conveyed
to the General, who ordered out two companies of the
44th Regiment, under Captains Swayne and Robinson, to
reinforce the party at the commissariat fort, or enable
them to <i>evacuate</i> it in safety.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> They had not proceeded
far, when the enemy, posted in Mahomed Sheriff’s Fort
opened upon them with deadly execution. The galling
fire of the concealed marksmen checked their progress.
Captains Swayne and Robinson were shot dead. Other
officers were wounded. There seemed to be no chance of
success. To move onward would only have been to expose
the detachment to certain destruction. The officer upon
whom the command of the party had devolved, determined,
therefore, to abandon an enterprise from which
nothing but further disaster could arise. He brought
back his party to cantonments; and so another failure
was added to the list.</p>

<p>Another was soon to be recorded against us. In the
course of the afternoon, the General determined to try the
effect of sending out a party, consisting mainly of cavalry,
to enable Lieutenant Warren to evacuate the commissariat
fort. But this party suffered more severely than the preceding
one. From the loopholes of Mahomed Sheriff’s
Fort&mdash;from every tree in the Shah’s garden&mdash;from whatever
cover of wood or masonry was to be found&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Afghan marksmen poured, with unerring aim, their deadly
fire upon our advancing troops. The unseen enemy was
too strong for our slight detachment. The troopers of the
5th Cavalry fell in numbers beneath the fire of the Afghan
matchlocks. The forward movement was checked. The
party retreated; and again the enemy gathered new
courage from the contemplation of our reverses.</p>

<p>In the mean while, it had become known to the commissariat
officers that the General contemplated the
abandonment of the fort, in which not only our grain, but
our hospital stores, our spirits, wine, beer, &amp;c., were
garnered. Dismayed at the thought of a sacrifice that
must entail destruction on the entire force, Captain Boyd,
the chief commissariat officer, hastened to General Elphinstone’s
quarters, and entreated him not to withdraw
Lieutenant Warren from the fort, but to reinforce him with
all possible despatch. The General, ever ready to listen
to advice, and sometimes to take it, heard all that was
advanced by the commissariat officer, readily assented to
its truth, and promised to send out a reinforcement to the
fort. But no reinforcement was sent. Night was closing
in upon the cantonment, and Captain Boyd, to his bitter
disappointment, perceived that no preparations were
making for the promised movement towards the fort.
Asking Captain Johnson to accompany him, he again proceeded
to the General’s quarters, where the two officers,
in emphatic language, pointed out the terrible results of
the sacrifice of our supplies. Again the General listened;
again he assented; and again he would have promised
all that was required; but other officers were present, who
put forth other opinions; talked of the danger of the
movement; urged that it would be necessary, in the first
instance, to capture Mahomed’s Sheriff’s Fort; and so the
General wavered. But at this juncture, another letter from
Lieutenant Warren was brought in. It represented that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
his position had become more insecure; that the enemy
were mining under the walls, and the Sepoys escaping
over them; and that if reinforcements were not speedily
sent, he should be compelled to abandon his position.</p>

<p>This brought the General round again to the opinion
that reinforcements ought to be sent; he promised that,
soon after midnight a detachment should be under arms
to take Mahomed Sheriff’s Fort, and to strengthen
Warren’s position; and the requisite orders were accordingly
issued. But later counsels prevailed. The march
of the detachment was postponed to the following morning;
and, before it moved, the little garrison had abandoned
the fort and returned to cantonments, leaving all our
supplies in the hands of the enemy, and inspiring them
with fresh confidence and courage. Warren, a man of a
reserved and taciturn nature, but of great courage and
resolution, had done his best to defend the place; and had
set an example of personal daring to his men, which ought
to have inspired and invigorated them. On one occasion,
amidst a deadly shower from the Afghan jezails, he had
advanced alone, and torn down the national standard
which the Afghans had planted at the gate of the fort.
But the Sepoys had lost heart. It was impossible to continue
the defence of the place. So the little party escaped
by working a hole from the interior of the fort underneath
the walls, by the aid of tools which had been sent them
for a different purpose on the preceding night.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Nor was this our only loss. The commissariat fort, in
which the supplies for Shah Soojah’s force were stored, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
on the outskirts of the city. In 1840, when a general
rising was deemed no unlikely occurrence, Captain Johnson
laid in a supply of 17,000 maunds of attah for Shah
Soojah’s force, and had erected godowns for their reception
within the Balla Hissar, where early in 1841 the grain was
all laid up in store. The King, however, subsequently
exercised the royal privilege of changing his mind. The
godowns were inconveniently situated; and Captain Johnson
was ordered to remove the grain from the citadel, and,
having no better place for its reception, to convert his
camel-sheds, on the outskirts of the city, into a godown
fort.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> In this fort, on the 2nd of November, there were
about 8000 maunds of attah. Captain Mackenzie (who
had then been for some months in charge of the executive
commissariat of the Shah’s troops), an officer of high character,
greatly and deservedly esteemed by the Envoy and
all the officers of the force, was at this time in charge of
the fort. On the morning of the 2nd of November, it
was attacked by the armed population of Deh-Afghan.
Throughout the whole of that day Mackenzie held his post
with unvarying constancy and unshaken courage. Everything
was against the little garrison. Water was scarce;
ammunition was scarce. They were encumbered with
baggage, and overwhelmed with women and children.
Reinforcements were written for in vain. Captain Trevor,
who occupied, with his family, a neighbouring fort,
despatched repeated letters to cantonments, importuning
the Envoy to reinforce these isolated posts. But in vain
they turned their straining eyes towards the cantonment,
“looking for the glittering bayonets through the trees.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Not a company came to their relief. Instead of assistance
they received nothing but melancholy tidings of disaster.
A demonstration from the cantonment would have saved
them. Captain Lawrence had volunteered to take two
companies to the relief of the fort; but permission was
denied to him. The Kuzzilbashes, too, were ready to
declare themselves on the side of the British. Khan
Sheeren Khan was, indeed, at Trevor’s house. But when
the chiefs saw that not an effort was made by the British
commanders to vindicate our authority, or to save the
lives of our officers, they prudently held aloof and refused
to link themselves with a declining cause.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of November, “about the middle of the
day,” the enemy got possession of Trevor’s house; and
it soon became certain that Mackenzie, with all his gallantry
and all his laborious zeal&mdash;working day and night
without food and without rest&mdash;conducting the defence
with as much judgment as spirit&mdash;could not much longer
hold his post. His men were wearied out; his ammunition
was exhausted; his wounded were dying for want of
medical aid. He had defended his position throughout
two days of toil, suffering, and danger; and no aid had
come from cantonments&mdash;none was likely to come. So
yielding at last to the importunity of others, he moved
out of the fort, and fought his way, by night, to cantonments.
It was a difficult and hazardous march; and,
almost by a miracle, Mackenzie escaped to encounter new
dangers, to sustain new trials, and to live in habitual
gratitude to God for his wonderful preservation.</p>

<p>The abandonment of our commissariat stores not only
threatened the British force with instant starvation, but
made such a lamentable exposure of our imbecility, that
all who had before held aloof, thinking that the British
nation would arise and crush the insurgents, now gathered
heart and openly declared themselves against us. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
doubtful were assured; the wavering were established.
There was a British army looking over the walls of their
cantonment at an ill-armed enemy&mdash;almost a rabble&mdash;gutting
their commissariat fort. There were the spoliators,
within four hundred yards of our position, carrying off our
supplies, as busily as a swarm of ants. “The godown
fort,” wrote Captain Johnson in his journal, “was this
day something similar to a large ants’ nest. Ere noon,
thousands and thousands had assembled from far and
wide, to participate in the booty of the English dogs, each
man taking away with him as much as he could carry&mdash;and
to this we were all eye-witnesses.” The troops
were grievously indignant at the imbecility of their
leaders, who had suffered them to be so ignominiously
stripped of the very means of subsistence; and clamoured
to be led out against the enemy, who were parading their
spoils under the very walls of the cantonment.</p>

<p>The feeling was not one to be checked. Lieutenant
Eyre went to the quarters of the General, urged him to
send out a party for the capture of Mahomed Sheriff’s
Fort, and volunteered to keep the road clear for the
advance of the storming party. With some reluctance
the General assented, and wrote to the Envoy saying, that
after due consideration he had determined on attacking
the fort, with fifty men of the 44th, and 200 Native
Infantry. “We will first try to breach the place,” he
added, “and shell it as well as we can. From information
I have received respecting the interior of the fort, which
I think is to be relied on, it seems the centre, like our old
bazaar, is filled with buildings; therefore, if we succeed
in blowing open the gate, we should only be exposed to a
destructive fire from the buildings, which, from the state
of preparation they evince, would no doubt be occupied in
force, supported from the garden. Carrying powder-bags
up under fire would have a chance of failure. Our men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
have been all night in the works, are tired, and ill-fed;
but we must hope for the best, and securing our commissariat
fort with the stores.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>It was in this letter, written scarcely three days after
the first outbreak of the insurrection, that the General
first hinted at the necessity of treating with the insolent
enemy. “It behoves us,” he wrote, “to look to the consequences
of failure: in this case I know not how we are
to subsist, or, from want of provisions, to retreat. You
should, therefore, consider what chance there is of making
terms, if we are driven to this extremity. Shelton must
then be withdrawn, as we shall not be able to supply him.”
What hope was there for the national honour after this?
What but failure was likely to result from an expedition
undertaken under such auspices? The party was sent
out under Major Swayne. It seems to have stood still,
when it ought to have rushed forward. The opportunity
was lost; and the General, who was watching the movement
from the gateway, ordered the detachment to be
withdrawn. The Sepoys of the 37th regiment who had
been eager to advance to the capture of the fort, were
enraged and disappointed at being held back; and the
enemy, more confident and presumptuous than before,
exulted in a new triumph.</p>

<p>Whilst affairs were in this distressing and dispiriting
state at Caubul, our outposts were exposed to imminent
danger; and it was soon only too plain that the insurrection
was not confined to the neighbourhood of the capital.
At Kardurrah Lieutenant Maule, of the Bengal Artillery,
commanding the Kohistanee regiment, with his adjutant
and sergeant-major, had been cut to pieces at the outset
of the insurrection, by the men of his own corps; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
now intelligence came in that the Goorkha regiment,
posted at Charekur in the Kohistan, where Eldred Pottinger
was acting as Political Agent, was threatened with
annihilation. Captain Codrington, the commandant, and
other officers had been killed; and as water was failing
the garrison, there was little chance of its holding out.
The Envoy communicated these sad tidings to the General,
who wrote in reply, that the intelligence was “most
distressing;” and asked whether “nothing could be done
by the promise of a large reward&mdash;a lakh of rupees for
instance, if necessary, to any of the Kohistan chiefs,” to
bring off the little garrison.</p>

<p>This was written on the 6th of November. That day
witnessed our first success. A party, under Major Griffiths,
of the 37th Native Infantry, was sent out against Mahomed
Sheriff’s Fort. A practicable breach was effected, and the
storming party entered with an irresistible impetuosity,
worthy of British troops. Ensign Raban, of the 44th
regiment, was shot dead on the crest of the breach. The
garrison escaped to the hills, where a party of Anderson’s
horse dashed at them in gallant style, and drove them
from their position. The rest of the day was spent in
dubious skirmishing. All arms were employed in a wild
desultory manner. Artillery, cavalry, and infantry did
good independent service; but they did not support each
other. Nothing great was designed or attempted. A
general action might have been brought on; and, properly
commanded at that time, the British troops, who were
then eager to meet the enemy, might have beaten five
times their numbers in the field. But General Elphinstone,
long before this, had ceased to think of beating the
enemy. Everything seemed possible to him but that.</p>

<p>We had lost our commissariat forts; but, happily, we
had not lost our commissariat officers. As soon as it was
perceived that our stores were in jeopardy, Captain Boyd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and Captain Johnson had begun to exert themselves, with
an energy as praiseworthy as it was rare in that conjuncture,
to collect supplies from the surrounding villages.
They were more successful than under such circumstances
could have been anticipated. The villagers sold the grain
which they had laid up for their own winter supplies, at
no very exorbitant rates, and the horrors of immediate
starvation were averted from the beleagured force. The
troops were put upon half-rations. The ordinary food of
the native troops&mdash;the <i>attah</i>, or ground wheat&mdash;was
wanting, for the water-mills in the villages had been
destroyed; but the unbroken grain was served out to
them in its stead.</p>

<p>A new danger was now to be discovered. The force
had been threatened with starvation; but now supplies
were coming in from the surrounding villages. It would
have been impossible to hold out without provisions. It
would be equally impossible to hold out without ammunition.
As soon as the one danger was averted, the General
began to look about for the approach of the other. On
the 6th of November, he again wrote to Sir William Macnaghten,
suggesting the expediency of making terms, with
the least possible delay:&mdash;“We have temporarily,” he
said, “and I hope permanently, got over the difficulty of
provisions. Our next consideration is ammunition; a very
serious and indeed awful one. We have expended a great
quantity; therefore it becomes worthy of thought on your
part, how desirable it is that our operations should not
be protracted by anything in treating that might tend to
a continuance of the present state of things. Do not
suppose from this I wish to recommend, or am advocating
humiliating terms, or such as would reflect disgrace on
us; but this fact of ammunition must not be lost sight
of.” And in a postscript to this letter are these melancholy
words:&mdash;“Our case is not yet desperate; I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
mean to impress that; but it must be borne in mind that
it goes very fast.”<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The Envoy needed no better proof
than this that our case, if not desperate, was “going very
fast.” There was an abundant supply of ammunition in
store. But what hope was there, so long as the troops
were thus commanded? There was no hope from our arms;
but something might be done by our money. If the
enemy could not be beaten off, he might be bought off.
The Envoy, therefore, began to appeal to the cupidity of
the chiefs.</p>

<p>The agent whom he employed was Mohun Lal. On
the first outbreak in the city, the Moonshee had narrowly
escaped destruction by taking refuge under the skirts of
Mohamed Zemaun Khan.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Since that time he had resided
in Caubul, under the protection of the Kuzzilbash chief
Khan Shereen Khan, and had kept up a correspondence
with Sir William Macnaghten, doing the Envoy’s bidding,
as he said, at the risk of his life. His first experiment
was made upon the corruptibility of the Ghilzyes. At the
request of the Envoy, Mohun Lal opened negotiations
with the chiefs of the tribe, offering them two lakhs of
rupees, with an immediate advance of a quarter of the
amount; but before the contract was completed, the
Envoy, doubtful, perhaps, of the sincerity of the chiefs,
receded from the negotiation. The Ghilzyes were mortally
offended; but the Envoy had another game in hand. On
the 7th of November, he wrote to Mohun Lal, authorising
him to assure our friends Khan Shereen Khan and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Mahomed Kumye, that if they performed the service
which they had undertaken, the former should receive one
lakh, and the latter 50,000 rupees, “besides getting the
present, and everything else they require.” “You may
assure them,” added Macnaghten, “that, whatever bluster
the rebels may make, they will be beaten in the end. I
hope that you will encourage Mohamed Yar Khan, the
rival of Ameen-oollah; assure him that he shall receive
the chiefship, and all the assistance necessary to enable
him to support it. You may give promises in my name
to the extent of 500,000 rupees (five lakhs).”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Intelligence had by this time reached Caubul from
many sources, to the effect that Mahomed Akbar Khan,
the second son of Dost Mahomed, was coming in from
Toorkistan, and had already advanced as far as Bameean;
and Macnaghten had now begun to credit and to attach
due importance to the news. Mohun Lal suggested the
expediency of despatching an emissary to meet the Sirdar
on the way, and offer him a handsome allowance to league
himself with our party. To this the Envoy replied, that
Mahomed Akbar’s arrival at Bameean was likely enough;
but that there could be little use in offering him a separate
remittance, if the rebels had made already overtures to
him.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> He had more hope from the good offices of the
Kuzzilbash chief and others on the spot, disposed to aid
us, and he commended Mohun Lal for raising money to
distribute among them. But he thought that, until
assured of a good return, it would be better to scatter
promises than coin; and so Mohun Lal was told not to
advance more than 50,000 rupees until some service had
been actually rendered.</p>

<p>But neither money actually spent, nor larger promises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
given, could really aid us in such an extremity. There
were too many hungry appetites to appease&mdash;too many
conflicting interests to reconcile; it was altogether, by
this time, too mighty a movement to be put down by a
display of the money-bags. The jingling of the coin
could not drown the voice of an outraged and incensed
people.</p>

<p>I wish that I had nothing more to say of the efforts
made, out of the fair field of open battle, to destroy the
power of the insurgent chiefs. There is a darker page of
history yet to be written. This Mohun Lal had other
work entrusted to him than that spoken of in these letters.
He was not directed merely to appeal to the cupidity of
the chiefs, by offering them large sums of money to exert
their influence in our favour. He was directed, also, to
offer rewards for the heads of the principal insurgents.
As early as the 5th of November, Lieutenant John Conolly,
who was in attendance upon Shah Soojah in the Balla
Hissar, wrote thus to Mohun Lal:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">Tell the Kuzzilbash chiefs, Shereen Khan, Naib Sheriff, in fact,
all the chiefs of Sheeah persuasion, to join against the rebels. You
can promise one lakh of rupees to Khan Shereen on the condition
of his killing and seizing the rebels and arming all the Sheeahs, and
immediately attacking all rebels. This is the time for the Sheeahs
to do good service. Explain to them that, if the Soonees once get
the upper hand in the town, they will immediately attack and
plunder their part of the town; hold out promises of reward and
money; write to me very frequently. Tell the chiefs who are well
disposed, to send respectable agents to the Envoy. Try and spread
“nifak” among the rebels. In everything that you do consult me,
and write very often. Meer Hyder Purja-Bashi has been sent to
Khan Shereen, and will see you.</p>

<p class="p1">And in a postscript to this letter appeared the ominous
words: “I promise 10,000 rupees for the head of each of
the principal rebel chiefs.”</p>

<p>Mohun Lal received this letter, and being ready for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
any kind of service not in the field, began to cast about
in his mind the best means of accomplishing the object
spoken of in Conolly’s postscript, with the least danger to
himself and the greatest benefit to his employers. It was
necessary, however, to tread cautiously in so delicate a
matter. The Moonshee was not yet assured of the temper
of the Kuzzilbash chief; and the game might be played
away by one precipitate move. So he resolved to keep
the offer of the head-money in abeyance for a few days,
and to watch the course of events.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">[November, 1841.]</p>

<p class="pch">Progress of the Insurrection&mdash;General Elphinstone&mdash;His Infirmities&mdash;Recall
of Brigadier Shelton to Cantonments&mdash;Capture of the Ricka-bashee
Fort&mdash;Intrigues with the Afghan Chiefs&mdash;The Envoy’s
Correspondence with Mohun Lal.</p>

<p><span class="beg">The</span> insurrection had now been raging for a week. The
enemy had increased in numbers and in daring. The
troops in the British cantonments were dispirited and disheartened.
The General had begun to talk and to write
about negotiation. The Envoy was attempting to buy off
the enemy. Nothing had yet been done to avert the
disastrous and disgraceful catastrophe which now threatened
to crown our misfortunes. It was plain that something
must be done. Any change would be a change for
the better.</p>

<p>The officers, who served under General Elphinstone
throughout this unhappy crisis, have invariably spoken of
him with tenderness and respect. He was an honourable
gentleman&mdash;a kind-hearted man; and he had once been a
good soldier. His personal courage has never been questioned.
Regardless of danger and patient under trial, he
exposed himself without reserve, and bore his sufferings
without complaining. But disease had broken down his
physical strength, and enfeebled his understanding. He
had almost lost the use of his limbs. He could not walk;
he could hardly ride. The gout had crippled him in a
manner that it was painful to contemplate. You could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
not see him engaged in the most ordinary concerns of
peaceful life without an emotion of lively compassion.
He was fit only for the invalid establishment on the day
of his arrival in India. It was a mockery to talk of his
commanding a division of the army in the quietest district
of Hindostan. But he was selected by Lord Auckland,
against the advice of the Commander-in-Chief and the
remonstrances of the Agra governor, to assume the command
of that division of the army which of all others was
most likely to be actively employed, and which demanded,
therefore, the greatest amount of energy and activity in its
commander. Among the general officers of the Indian
army were many able and energetic men, with active
limbs and clear understandings. There was one&mdash;a cripple,
whose mental vigour much suffering had enfeebled; and
<i>he</i> was selected by the Governor-General to command the
army in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Ever since his arrival at the head quarters at Caubul
he had been, in his own words, “unlucky in the state
of his health.” From the beginning of May to the
beginning of October he had been suffering, with little
intermission, from fever and rheumatic gout. Sometimes
he had been confined wholly to his couch; at others he
was enabled to go abroad in a palanquin. During one or
two brief intervals he had sufficiently recovered his strength
to trust himself on the back of a horse. He was in the
enjoyment of one of these intervals&mdash;but expecting every
day to relinquish a burden which he was so ill able to
bear<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>&mdash;when on the 2nd of November, whilst inspecting
the guards, he “had a very severe fall&mdash;the horse falling
upon him,”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and he was compelled to return to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
quarters. From that time, though he never spared himself,
it was painfully obvious that the Caubul army was
without a chief. The General was perplexed&mdash;bewildered.
He was utterly without resources of his own. A crisis had
come upon him, demanding all the energies of a robust
constitution and a vigorous understanding; and it had
found him with a frame almost paralysed by disease, and
a mind quite clouded by suffering. He had little knowledge
of the political condition of Afghanistan, of the
feelings of the people, of the language they spoke, or the
country they inhabited. He was compelled, therefore, to
rely upon the information of others, and to seek the advice
of those with whom he was associated. So circumstanced,
the ablest and most confident general would have been
guided by the counsels of the British Envoy. But General
Elphinstone was guided by every man’s counsels&mdash;generally
by the last speaker’s&mdash;by captains and subalterns,
by any one who had a plan to propose or any kind
of advice to offer. He was, therefore, in a constant state
of oscillation; now inclining to one opinion, now to
another; now determining upon a course of action, now
abandoning it; the resolutions of one hour giving way
before the doubts of its successor, until, in the midst of
these vacillations, the time to strike passed away for ever,
and the loss was not to be retrieved.</p>

<p>In such a conjuncture, there could have been no greater
calamity than the feeble indecision of the military
commander. Promptitude of action was the one thing
demanded by the exigences of the occasion; but instead of
promptitude of action, there was nothing but hesitation
and incertitude; long delays and small doings, worse than
nothing; paltry demonstrations, looking as though they
were expressly designed as revelations of the lamentable
weakness of our arms, and the more lamentable imbecility
of our counsels. To the Envoy all this was miserably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
apparent. It was apparent to the whole garrison. It was
not possible altogether to supersede the General. He was
willing, with all his incompetency, to serve his country,
and there was no authority in Afghanistan to remove him
from his command. But something, it was thought,
might be done by associating with him, in the command
of the cantonment force, an officer of a more robust frame
and more energetic character. Brigadier Shelton was
known to be an active and a gallant soldier. Macnaghten
counselled his recall from the Balla Hissar, and the General
believing, or perhaps only hoping, that he would find a
willing coadjutor in the Brigadier, despatched a note to
him with instructions to come into cantonments.</p>

<p>Taking with him only a regiment of the Shah’s troops
and a single gun, the Brigadier quitted the Balla Hissar
on the morning of the 9th of November, and made his way,
without any interruption, to the cantonment, in broad
daylight. The garrison welcomed him with cordiality.
He came amongst them almost as a deliverer. Great
things were expected from him. He was beloved neither
by officers nor by men; but he was held to possess some
sturdy qualities, and never to shrink from fighting. Little
or nothing was known of his aptitude as a leader. He
had seldom or never been placed in a position of responsible
command. But the time for weighing nice questions
of generalship had long ago passed away. The garrison
were content to look for a commander to lead them against
the enemy, with sufficient promptitude and in sufficient
numbers to protect them against the certainty of failure.
But a week of almost unbroken disaster had dispirited and
enfeebled them. Everything that Shelton saw and heard
was of a nature to discourage him. Anxious faces were
around him, and desponding words saluted his ears. He
went round the cantonments, and saw at once how large a
force it required to defend such extensive works, and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
small a body of troops could be spared for external operations.
Everything, indeed, was against him. He had not
been sent for, until a series of disasters had crippled our
means of defence, emboldened the enemy, disheartened
the garrison, and brought the grim shadow of starvation
close to the cantonment walls.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>But there was another evil soon to become only too
painfully apparent. Brigadier Shelton had been sent for
to co-operate with the General; but it was manifest that
there was never likely to be any co-operation between
them. Each has left upon record his opinion of the
conduct of the other. The General says that the Brigadier
was contumacious and insubordinate. The Brigadier says
that he was thwarted in all his efforts to do good service&mdash;that
he could not even place a gun in position without
being reminded by the General that he had no independent
command. Upon whomsoever the greater amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of blame may rest, the result was sufficiently deplorable.
The military chiefs never acted in concert.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Shelton
was a man of a hard uncompromising nature, and it is
probable that he had little toleration for the indecision of
the general, and was little inclined to regard with tenderness
and compassion the infirmities of the poor old chief.
He did what he was commanded to do, if not with much
military skill, at all events with an unflinching gallantry,
to which the general himself bore willing testimony.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
But from the absence of a right understanding between
them a fatality attended almost every enterprise. Hesitation
and delay at the outset&mdash;then vacillation and contradiction&mdash;resolutions
taken and then abandoned&mdash;orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
issued and then countermanded&mdash;so irritated the Brigadier,
that his temper, never of a very genial cast, was generally
in a somewhat tempestuous state before he took the field
at the head of his men. How far we may rightly attribute
to this the want of success which attended the Brigadier’s
operations can only now be conjectured; but it is very
certain that in all of them the daring of the soldier was
more conspicuous than the judgment of the commander.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the Envoy was anxiously looking for
the return of Sale’s brigade from Gundamuck. He doubted
the possibility of their being beset by any serious difficulties.
He had written to Mohun Lal on the 8th,
cautioning him not to place any reliance on the story
about Gundamuck, for Sale’s force, he said, was “too strong
to be resisted by any force that the rebels could bring
against them.” And on the following day he despatched
another letter to Captain Macgregor, urging him to send
back the troops to the relief of our beleaguered position.
Only a fragment of this letter has been preserved; but it
sufficiently indicates the Envoy’s opinion of the melancholy,
almost desperate, state to which our affairs had even then
attained. “I have written to you several letters,” said
Macnaghten, “urging you in the strongest manner to
come up with Sale’s brigade to our relief, but I fear you
may not have received them. Our situation is rather a
desperate one unless you arrive, because we can neither
retreat in any direction, nor leave the cantonments to go
into the Balla Hissar; but if we had your force we should
be able to take the city, and thus preserve both the
cantonment and Balla Hissar. The enemy is a contemptible
one.”<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> From the return of Sale’s brigade alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
did the Envoy look for any permanent change in the
condition of affairs at Caubul. But from that quarter no
assistance could come. The force was moving in another
direction.</p>

<p>But whatever might be the chance of permanent improvement
in the condition of affairs, it was still necessary
to do something for the moment. On the morning of the
10th of November, the enemy mustered in great numbers&mdash;horse
and foot&mdash;on the heights commanding the cantonment,
sending up shouts of insolent defiance and firing
<i>feux de joie</i>. There were some small forts on the plain
below, perilously near our cantonment walls, and in these
the enemy presently posted themselves, and grievously
harassed our soldiers on the works. One of these, known
as the Ricka-bashee Fort, situated near the north-east
angle of the cantonment, was within musket-shot of our
walls. It was easy to pour in thence a galling fire upon
the troops manning our works; and the artillerymen at
the guns were shot down by the deadly aim of the Afghan
marksmen, concealed in the ruins of some adjacent houses.
This was not to be endured. It is hard to believe that,
whilst his men were being shot down before his eyes by
hidden marksmen, the military chief could have needed
much prompting to send out a party for the capture of the
fort that so commanded our position. But it was only on
the urgent representation of the Envoy that an expedition
against the Ricka-bashee Fort was undertaken at last.
There was a fine manly spirit&mdash;there were some good, true
soldierly qualities, in Macnaghten; and he told the military
commander that he did not shrink from responsibility&mdash;that,
in such a case as this, he would take it all upon himself,
but that at any risk the fort must be carried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Reluctantly the General consented; and a force under
Brigadier Shelton, consisting of about two thousand men
of all arms, was ordered to hold itself in readiness.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The
force assembled about the hour of noon. The Brigadier
was making his dispositions for the attack, when it again
occurred to the General that the expedition was a dangerous
one (as though war were not always dangerous), and that
it would be more prudent to abandon it. The aide-de-camp
at his elbow asked him why, if such were his opinions,
he did not countermand it at once. And so the expedition
was countermanded; and the Brigadier returned “disgusted
with such vacillation.”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The troops were brought back within the cantonment
walls; and the Brigadier, overflowing with indignation,
laid the case before the Envoy. Macnaghten was as
eager as Shelton for the movement; and the scruples of
the General were overruled. But time had now been lost.
The enemy’s position had been strengthened. The spirit
of our troops had been damped&mdash;their forwardness had
been checked. The expedition set out with diminished
chances of success, and the result was a dubious victory.</p>

<p>The Ricka-bashee Fort was captured on that 10th of
November, but in a disastrous and calamitous manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
which made the victory look more like a defeat. It was
determined to blow open the gate with powder-bags,
and Captain Bellew, the Assistant Quartermaster-General,
gallantly volunteered to undertake the work of destruction.
But, by some accident, instead of blowing open
the main gate, he blew open a small wicket. Two companies
of European and four companies of Native troops<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
had been told off to form the storming party; and
Colonel Mackrell, of the 44th, was ordered to command
it. The men, gallantly commanded, advanced with spirit
to the attack; but they could with difficulty make their
way through the narrow aperture, and the enemy, as they
struggled forward, poured upon them a hot and destructive
fire. Colonel Mackrell and Lieutenant Bird forced
their way, with a few soldiers, into the fort. Captain
Westmacott was shot down outside the aperture, and
Captain Macrae sabred in the entrance. The few who
made good their way into the interior of the fort struck
a panic into the garrison, who, believing that the whole
party were following them, fled in dismay out of the
opposite gate. But the storming party, unhappily at
this time, were checked by a charge of Afghan horse.
The cry of “Cavalry” seems to have paralysed the
British musketeers, who wavered, turned, and were soon
in disastrous flight&mdash;Europeans and Sepoys together. In
vain their officers endeavoured to urge them on to the
attack&mdash;in vain they pleaded the desperate condition of
those who had already entered, if they were not speedily
supported. One man&mdash;a private of the 44th, named
Stewart&mdash;alone volunteered to follow them. It was not
easy to rally the fugitives. Confusion and dismay had
seized them, and for some time they were deaf to every
appeal. But they were commanded by one who at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
was a brave soldier. Brigadier Shelton was a man of iron
nerves and dauntless courage. Where the fire was the
hottest he stood unshaken by the danger that assailed
him, and shamed the disordered crowd of men, no longer
soldiers. The example of the one-armed veteran did
more than his exhortations. The broken bands rallied,
re-formed, and advanced to the attack. But again they
gave way to the Afghan horse; and again Shelton’s
expostulations and example brought the waverers back
to their duty. The heavy guns from the cantonments
were by this time playing upon the Afghan cavalry; the
impetuosity of the enemy was thus restrained, and
Shelton led up his men to the capture of the fort.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the few brave men who had made
good their entrance through the wicket were beset by
the deadliest peril. Many of the garrison, discovering
how small was the real number of their assailants, had
returned with new courage to the fort. The devoted
Englishmen had endeavoured to secure themselves by
shutting the gate through which the garrison had escaped,
and securing the chain with a bayonet. But the enemy
had removed this slender obstacle, and rushed in upon
the little storming party. Colonel Mackrell was found
fearfully wounded and disfigured, and was carried into
cantonments to die. Lieutenant Bird, with two Sepoys
of the 37th N.I., sought refuge in a stable, which they
barricaded and defended with a resolution that deserved
and secured a crown of success. When the fort was
carried by the British troops they were found, with
exhausted ammunition, but alive and uninjured. Thirty
of the enemy had been shot down by the gallant three.</p>

<p>On the fall of the Ricka-bashee Fort some small adjacent
forts were abandoned by the enemy, and a quantity
of grain fell into our hands, only to be lost again for
want of proper measures to secure it. Before the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
closed, Shelton had threatened the enemy, who had
collected in some force on the Seeah Sungh hills. The
Horse Artillery guns opened with good effect, and the
enemy retired towards the city; but no attempt seems
to have been made, on our part, to bring on a general
action. On this 10th of November, for the first time
any considerable body of troops was brought into the
field. The opportunity of making a decided impression
was a good one; but it was not turned to good account.
The whole affair was mismanaged. The spirit of the
troops was damped at the outset by the vacillation of
the General. A grievous error was committed in attempting,
for want of information to be easily obtained, an
entrance at the wrong point, into the Ricka-bashee
Fort. Then the force sent out under Brigadier Shelton
was lamentably weak in the mounted branch, although
there was no want of cavalry in cantonments. Had the
infantry been supported by a stronger body of horse,
they would have had more confidence in themselves, and
suffered less severely in the action. A strong reserve,
too, should have been held in readiness for employment
in the event of the party meeting with any check, or
requiring any support. As it was, when the Afghan
horse attacked our columns and threw them into confusion,
there was nothing to give them any confidence
but the gallantry of their leaders.</p>

<p>The result, however, of the capture of the forts,
though the achievement was clouded by a melancholy
loss of life, was more satisfactory than would be supposed
from such a recital of the errors that attended it. The
Envoy, indeed, subsequently declared that it averted the
necessity of a disastrous retreat.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> We had got possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of some positions contiguous to the cantonment, the
occupation of which by the enemy had grievously distressed
our force. For two or three days after the capture
the Afghans did little to annoy us. The commissariat
officers took advantage of the opportunity to add
to their available supplies;<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and whilst they were endeavouring
to buy grain, the Envoy was doing his best
to buy the enemy. The negotiations with the Ghilzyes,
which had been broken off, were resumed; and every
possible effort was made to win over the chiefs to our
cause, or to sow dissension among them. In all these
operations he employed the agency of Mohun Lal. The
hasty letters written to this individual best unfold the
nature of these transactions. On the 11th of November
he thus addressed the Moonshee: “You will observe
from the enclosed letters that I have confirmed the promises
made by you to the Ghilzye rebels; though had
you known of our successes yesterday, the terms might
have been more favourable for us. Humza Khan should
come to me as soon as possible, and I will then talk to
him about the case of Gool Mahomed. The money
could not be paid until the conditions of the agreement
are fulfilled, and we are perfectly certain of the fidelity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
of Humza and the chiefs. The chiefs should go at once
and pay their respects to his Majesty. You should encourage
the rival of Ameen-oollah Khan by all possible
means. That scoundrel and Abdoollah Khan should be
executed, if we could catch them.”<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>And again, writing two days afterwards, he said: “I
have received your letter of this morning’s date, and
highly approve of all you have done. Let Golam Hussan
and Abdool-Ruheem Khan undertake to come to the
Zoolfikar Fort this morning, and Captain Trevor will be
ready there to receive them. Captain Trevor will be in
that fort night and day, for some time, to receive overtures
from any person; and parties coming in should send
a single messenger before them. Khan Shereen Khan is
quite right not to leave the Chundawul for a day or two.
Tell Naib Sheriff he may safely go security to the Ghilzyes
for the payment of the money. When I see Humza Khan
I will talk to him about the best plan for the Ghilzye
chiefs to wait on his Majesty. You are aware that I
would give a reward of 10,000 rupees for the apprehension
of Ameen-oollah Khan and such of the Douranee rebel
chiefs. If you could see some of the officers of the Hazirbash
corps that is just come in with Mahomed Azeem
Khan, and give them encouragement, it would be very
desirable.”<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>If there had been any hope of rescuing our force from
destruction by honest fighting in the field, the Envoy
would not have resorted to such shifts as are indicated
in these letters. But he had unhappily discovered that
the military commanders had abandoned all hope of
beating the enemy, and were thinking of making their
way out of the thicket of danger that encompassed them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
by a path less honourable and less secure. Anxious
above all things to escape the disgrace of an open capitulation,
which would have humiliated us in the eyes of
all the nations of the East, the Envoy exerted all his
diplomatic skill to create disunion among our principal
enemies&mdash;to buy off those whose cupidity was stronger
than their hatred&mdash;and to offer a reward for the seizure
of others.</p>

<p>All this was at least within the range of orthodox
diplomacy. But in the meanwhile that other, darker
agency, of which I reluctantly spoke at the close of my
last chapter, was being brought into operation. On the
11th of November, John Conolly again wrote to Mohun
Lal: “Why do you not write? What has become of
Meer Hyder? Is he doing anything with Khan Shereen?
You never told me whether you had written to Naib
Humza. What do the rebels propose doing now? Have
you not made any arrangements about the bodies of the
murdered officers? Offer 2000 rupees to any one who
will take them to cantonments, or 1000 to any one who
will bury them. Has not Sir Alexander’s body been
found? Give my salaam to the Naib. If Khan Shereen
is not inclined to do service, try other Kuzzilbash chiefs
independently. Exert yourself. Write to me often, for
the news of Kossids is not to be depended on. There is
a man called Hadjee Ali, who might be induced by a
bribe to try and bring in the heads of one or two of the
<i>Mufsids</i>. Endeavour to let him know that 10,000 rupees
will be given for each head, or even 15,000 rupees. I
have sent to him two or three times.”</p>

<p>Mohun Lal, having by this time disencumbered himself
of some of his misgivings on the score of his own
personal safety, seems to have set about the work
entrusted to him with a zeal that must have abundantly
satisfied his employers. Hadjee Ali, and another man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
named Aga Mahomed Soudah, were the agents to whom
he first offered the price of the blood of their unhappy
countrymen. But the Moonshee, perplexed by doubts
rather than burdened with scruples, did not see very
clearly at first how the chiefs were to be taken off; so
he wrote to the Envoy that “he could not find out by
Lieutenant Conolly’s notes how the rebels are to be
assassinated, but the men now employed promise to go
into their houses and cut off their heads when they may
be without attendants.”</p>

<p>The victims said to have been first marked for the
assassin’s knife were Abdoollah Khan and Meer Musjedee.
They were known to have been the movers of the attack
on Burnes’s house; and were regarded, therefore, as the
murderers of the officers who were massacred there on
the morning of the outbreak. They were known, too,
as the boldest and most unscrupulous of the insurgent
chiefs. It seemed, therefore, an act alike of retribution
and expediency to strike them down in the full flush
of success&mdash;in the hey-day of their sanguinary career.
There is no need in this chapter to endeavour to penetrate
the mist of painful obscurity that envelopes the
disappearance of the two chiefs. It will be time to discuss
the subject when I come to record their deaths.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">[November-1841.]</p>

<p class="pch">Action on the Beh-meru Hills&mdash;Looked-for Advent of Sale’s Brigade&mdash;Arrival
of Pottinger&mdash;The Siege of Charekur&mdash;Destruction of the
Goorkha Regiment&mdash;Withdrawal of Sale to Jellalabad&mdash;Question
of Concentration in the Balla Hissar.&mdash;Bearing of the King&mdash;The
Action on the 23rd of November&mdash;Negotiations.</p>

<p><span class="beg">On</span> the 13th of November the enemy occupied, in great
strength, the Beh-meru hills. They had planted two
guns in a commanding position, and were cannonading
the British cantonment. It was at once apparent to the
Envoy that to leave them unmolested to fire into our
works would be miserably to confess our own weakness,
and to encourage the enemy in the continuance of a course
of aggression which might end in the loss of our post.
But it was difficult to persuade the military authorities
to send out a force to dislodge them. Captain Lawrence
was despatched, in the first instance, to the General;
but the message he bore was coldly received, and he
returned discouraged to the Envoy, with a recommendation
that he should prefer his request in person. Macnaghten
went. But the military chiefs were in no mood
to listen to his counsel. The pliant General would soon
have yielded; but the more dogmatic and self-confident
Brigadier was ready with a host of objections, and a great
array of difficulties, to overwhelm the arguments of the
Envoy. Macnaghten, however, was peremptory. The
guns, he said, must be taken at all risks, and at once, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the loss of cantonments to-morrow might be the result
of our supineness to-day. There was again a talk of
responsibility. The Envoy took the responsibility on
himself, and a strong detachment, with two guns, under
Brigadier Shelton,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> was ordered out for service.</p>

<p>But much time had been lost in these idle discussions.
It was nearly four o’clock before the troops were ready to
take the field. They moved out in three columns, and
taking different directions, pushed forward with a spirit
and a rapidity worthy of British troops, to the foot of
the hill. One, the most serviceable of the two guns that
had been sent out under Lieutenant Eyre, unfortunately
stuck fast, for some time, in a canal. But the advanced
body of the infantry, under the General’s aide-de-camp,
Major Thain, were eager to move forward before the guns,
thus delayed, could be brought to bear upon the enemy’s
position. Only one round of grape had been fired when
they closed with the enemy. It would have been well
had the insurgents been compelled to listen more to that
argument which takes no denial; for the musketry fire of
our detachment, though poured in at a distance of only
ten yards, scarcely took effect upon the insurgents. The
men took no aim&mdash;fired wildly&mdash;anywhere but in the
right direction. Emboldened by impunity, the Afghan
cavalry charged down upon the British bayonets with
irresistible force. No dispositions were made to receive
them. For a while all was panic and confusion. Friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and foe were mixed up together, as the column gave way,
and the horsemen charged through and through our ranks
until the rout was complete.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> It was only a temporary
check. The British troops retreated down the slope; but
rallied, re-formed behind the reserve at the foot of the
hill, and, under cover of the guns which Eyre was now
working with good effect, advanced again to the attack.
Anderson’s Horse now came into action, and making a
gallant charge, drove the enemy up the ascent. The
infantry followed, and carried the height, whilst the
enemy, escaping along the ridge, abandoned their guns
to the victors.</p>

<p>Night was now closing in upon the scene. The detachment
had been sent out to capture the enemy’s guns.
The guns were in our possession; but it would have
been the mere shadow of a victory if they had not been
carried off. The Envoy, who had watched the struggle
with painful anxiety, despatched a message of earnest
entreaty that no effort should be spared “to complete
the triumph of the day,”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> by bringing both the guns
into cantonments. One of the deserted guns was easily
removed by a party of the Shah’s 6th Infantry; but some
Afghan marksmen were pouring in so warm a fire upon
the other and larger piece, that the British soldier&mdash;all his
character reversed&mdash;seeing the danger and not the honour
of the exploit, shrunk from the perilous service, and refused
to advance for the capture of the gun.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> It was
nearly dark. The further detention of the force would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
have been attended with serious risk. Eyre, therefore,
spiked the gun, which it seemed impossible to carry off,
and then secured the capture of the other. The six-pounder
was rolled down the hill; the four-pounder was
carried into cantonments.</p>

<p>It was eight o’clock before Shelton’s force returned to
their quarters. The enemy intercepted their movements,
and threatened the cantonment, but the attack was repulsed
by a few rounds of grape, and a brisk fire from
Mackenzie’s jezailchees. Many, on both sides, had
fallen during the action of the afternoon. Major Thain
and Captain Paton were severely wounded. All night,
from the hill-side, came loud lamentations&mdash;the wailings
of the relatives of the Afghans who had fallen in the fight.
Lights were flitting about in every direction; for they
were burying the dead. On the following day they were
busy with the same melancholy work.</p>

<p>This affair of the 13th of November was set down as
a success; and it was wise to make the most of it. It
was the last success, even of a doubtful and equivocal
character, which the unhappy force was destined to
achieve. “Henceforward,” wrote one who has chronicled
with no common fidelity the events of these miserable
months,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> “it becomes my weary task to relate a catalogue
of errors, disasters, and difficulties, which, following close
upon each other, disgusted our officers, disheartened our
soldiers, and finally sunk us all into irretrievable ruin,
as though Heaven itself, by a combination of evil circumstances,
for its own inscrutable purposes, had planned our
downfall.”</p>

<p>For some days the enemy remained comparatively inactive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Occasional threatenings kept the garrison on the
alert; but little was done to change the posture of affairs.
The Envoy, still looking for the return of Sale’s brigade,
continued to write urgent letters to Captain Macgregor.
On the 12th, he had written: “I have written to you
four times, requesting that you would come up with Sale’s
brigade as soon as possible. We are still in a very bad
way, though not quite so badly off as we were four days
ago. Our force is so small that we cannot act on the
offensive, and we have not above a fortnight’s supplies.
I am trying, through Humza, to enter into some arrangements
with the <i>Mufsids</i>. As the Ghilzyes are occupied
here, I should think you would not meet with much opposition,
except, perhaps, in the Khoord Caubul Pass.”
And now again, on the 14th, he wrote (and it is plain
from this letter that he thought the action of the preceding
day had in nowise improved their condition):
“Dozens of letters have been written from this, urging
your immediate return with Sale’s brigade to Caubul;
and if you have not started by the time you receive this,
I earnestly beg that you will do so immediately. Our
situation is a very precarious one; but with your assistance
we should all do well, and you must render it to us,
if you have any regard for our lives or for the honour of
our country. We may be said to be in a state of siege;
and had we not made two desperate sallies, we should ere
now have been annihilated. We have provisions for only
ten days; but when you arrive we shall be able to
command the resources of the country. In our action of
yesterday Thain and Paton were wounded, the latter so
severely that his arm has been amputated. I have still
some hope of the Charekur detachment, but a faint one.
I have no news from Ghuzni or Candahar. In the interior
of the country they seem to be as <i>jaghee</i> as at the capital.
Mehtur Moosa joined the rebels yesterday. We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
been unmolested to-day, but it may be only the lull
before the storm. Humza Khan has promised to call on
me this evening. I have no idea that he will do so. I
intend to make much of him. I have written to you
several letters of late, so shall say no more for the present.
The Ghilzye force being here, I should conceive you will
experience no opposition on the road.”</p>

<p>The hopes expressed for the safety of the Charekur
detachment were dissipated on the following day. On
the 15th of November, Major Pottinger and Lieutenant
Haughton came in wounded from that place, and reported
that the Goorkha regiment had been cut to pieces.
They had held out for some time with noble resolution;
but their position was untenable for want of water. The
horrors of unappeasable thirst had overcome them; they
had been compelled to abandon their post; had attempted
to make good their retreat to Caubul; and had perished
by the way.</p>

<p>The story which Pottinger told must be briefly related.
Before the end of October the Kohistanees and
Nijrowees were in open revolt; and on the 1st of November,
Meer Musjedee, with a strong insurgent force,
moved across the plain of the Barakab and took up a
position at Akserai, completely cutting off the communication
between Charekur and Caubul.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Pottinger
and Codrington now took counsel together. The former,
as political agent on the Toorkistan frontier, resided in
the castle of Lughmanee, about two miles distant from
Charekur, where the Goorkha regiment was planted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
some fortified barracks, the defences of which were still
in course of construction. Codrington, who commanded
the regiment, was, at the dawn of November, with Pottinger
in the Lughmanee castle. Their position was one
of great difficulty. They sent out reconnoitring parties
to obtain intelligence of the precise position of the
enemy; but, encumbered as they were with women and
children, and almost wholly without carriage, it seemed
impossible that the Goorkha regiment could be moved
out of Charekur. Pottinger wrote to the Envoy for
troops, called upon all the friendly chiefs to aid him,
and began to strengthen his position. But it was soon
apparent that no help could come from Caubul, and that
the friends on whom he relied were, in fact, disguised
enemies. Many Kohistanee and Nijrowee chiefs visited
him on the two first days of November. Loud in their
expressions of friendship, they declared their willingness
to co-operate with him for the suppression of the insurrection;
but when he called upon them to attack the
castles of the chiefs who had gone out to join the army of
Meer Musjedee, it at once became apparent that they lied.
The suspicions of Pottinger were aroused. The “friends”
around him were assembling in such numbers as to form
an army of their own; and Pottinger, determined as he
was to betray neither suspicion nor alarm, could not help
feeling that a sudden attack was by no means an improbable
event to proceed out of all these armed gatherings.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 3rd, the numbers of armed men
around the Residency had increased. The reconnoitring
parties had not returned. The chiefs were asking for
presents, but refusing to do the service required of them.
Everything seemed enveloped in an atmosphere of doubt
and suspicion; and Pottinger, as he received the chiefs,
who came pressing in with offers of friendship, could not
help feeling that a struggle was at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Before noon, he received several of the more powerful
chiefs at the Residency, and at noon went out to meet
the petty Sirdars, who were clustering in the garden
around his house. With characteristic Afghan cupidity,
they assailed him with questions respecting the amount of
the rewards that would be paid for their services.
Pottinger entered into some explanations which the
foremost of the party seemed disposed to consider satisfactory;
but, expressing some doubts as to whether their
clansmen would be satisfied, they requested that the
nature of the overtures might be made known to those
who were removed from the circle around the British
Agent. Lieutenant Rattray, the Political Assistant, had
just joined Pottinger in the garden. He was now requested
to explain the matter to the rest, who were standing a
little way apart. Accompanied by the principal chiefs,
Rattray proceeded to the place where they were assembled,
and, after some conversation, they quitted the garden, and
repaired to “an adjoining stubble-field, where several
parties of aimed men were standing.”</p>

<p>It was not long before Rattray became aware that
treachery was brewing. He turned to leave the field,
and was immediately shot down. Pottinger was still
sitting in conversation with some of the chiefs, when a
man attached to the Hazerbash regiment ran up, and by
hints, rather than by intelligible words, apprised him of
the danger that surrounded him. The sound of firing
confirmed the ominous intelligence. The chiefs rose and
fled. Pottinger escaped into the castle, and from the
<i>terre-pleine</i> of the rampart looked down, and saw Rattray
lying badly wounded on the ground, and “the recent
tenderers of service making off in all directions with the
plunder of the Hazerbash camp.”<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Rattray was soon despatched. A party of the enemy,
crossing the plain and seeing the wounded officer at their
mercy, discharged their pieces into his head and body. They
then invested Pottinger’s position, firing upon him from
the shelter of the numerous water-courses and walls. But
assistance was now at hand. Lieutenant Haughton, the
adjutant of the Goorkha corps, was moving down from
Charekur. As soon as he appeared in the vicinity of the
garden. Captain Codrington made a sortie, and united
himself with the relieving force. The enemy were driven
out of the garden with severe loss. Evening was by this
time closing in. The enemy had got possession of the
Charekur road, and before any measures of future defence
could be concerted between the two officers, Codrington
was obliged, after leaving some details with Pottinger, to
move off his Goorkhas to his own fortified barracks. On
the following day, with four companies of Goorkhas, and a
six-pounder gun, Codrington moved down from Charekur,
to relieve Pottinger’s guard, and to supply his little garrison
with ammunition. Owing mainly, however, to the
impetuosity of a company of young soldiers,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> the column<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
met with a check, and was compelled to fall back on
Charekur. Ensign Salisbury was mortally wounded, and
many men of the Goorkha regiment fell on the retreat.</p>

<p>Seeing little prospect now of being relieved, and finding
his ammunition reduced to a few rounds in the pouches
of his men, Pottinger determined, after nightfall, to
attempt a retreat on Charekur. Disguising his intentions
by collecting grain during the day, as for a protracted
defence, he eluded the vigilance of the enemy, and disencumbering
himself of his Afghan followers, and all
whose fidelity there was any reason to suspect, he mustered
the Hindostanees outside the postern, upon the pretext of
making a sortie upon the enemy, and then marched for
the barracks. Avoiding the main road, and skirting the
edge of the mountain, the little party, under cover of the
night, made good its retreat, and united itself with the
main body of the Goorkha regiment at Charekur.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 5th of November the enemy
assembled in large bodies around the fortified barracks;
and, after attacking the outposts, closely invested the
place. Codrington commanded the regiment. Pottinger,
divesting himself of his political character, became the
artillery officer again, and took charge of the guns.
Moving out with a field-piece to support the skirmishers,
he was wounded by a musket-shot in the leg. But there
was too much work in hand for one of his temper to succumb
at once to such an accident as this. The enemy were
pressing fiercely on. Codrington and his Goorkhas were
confined to the barracks and a few mud huts in their
immediate neighbourhood. They stood their ground manfully
and well. But the hostile multitude poured like a
torrent upon the little band of devoted men.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The
Goorkhas were driven from the huts. They saw their
gallant commander fall mortally wounded; but they returned
undaunted to the attack. Haughton, the adjutant,
was now at their head. He led the men gallantly to the
charge, and drove back the enemy beyond the gardens
they had occupied in the morning. Again and again the
Afghans returned to the attack. But the little body of
Goorkhas, with heroic courage, held their ground till night
put an end to the conflict.</p>

<p>Amidst the tears and lamentations of his sepoys, Codrington,
with his death-wound upon him, but still manfully
striving to walk, had tottered, under support, to the
cantonment, but had there fallen to the ground, and in
an agony of thirst and calling for water, had then been
carried into his house and placed on a bed, where now disabled
by suffering, Eldred Pottinger was lying. Being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
supplied with writing materials, he wrote, as best he could,
a letter to his wife, gave her picture into Pottinger’s safe
keeping, and prepared himself to die. He lingered for
two days, and then was laid in the grave by his faithful
followers, beside one of his young companions in arms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the unequal contest had continued. At a
distance of some three hundred yards from the barracks
there was a castle, the towers of which so effectually commanded
them, that it was necessary to occupy the post
with a garrison of fifty men. But it was not very easy to
retain it. The enemy increased greatly in numbers on
the 6th; and, in spite of the successful sorties of the
Goorkhas, drove back their outposts, and confined them
within the narrow limits of their barracks. On the following
day, the castle garrison, betrayed by the regimental
Moonshee, were induced to surrender. The enemy took
possession of the place, and from its commanding towers
poured in a galling fire on the Goorkhas in the barracks.
The position of the little garrison was now becoming more
and more critical. Cut off by the enemy, water had
become lamentably scarce. They had lost half their
officers and a large number of their comrades. The
enemy had increased in number and in fury, and completely
commanded their position. To shut themselves
up in their barracks was to die of thirst; to attempt to
fight their way out was to be cut to pieces.</p>

<p>On the 8th, the enemy offered them terms. The condition
was, that they should become Mahomedans. “We
came to this country,” said Pottinger, in reply, “to aid a
Mahomedan sovereign in the recovery of his rights. We
are therefore within the pale of Islam, and exempt from
coercion on the score of religion.” To this they replied,
that the King himself had ordered the attack; and asked
if Pottinger would surrender on receiving his Majesty’s
orders. “I can do nothing,” said Pottinger, “without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
written order from the King.” And with this the negotiations
ended.</p>

<p>But there was an enemy more terrible than these
infuriated crowds of Kohistanees and Nijrowees. The
garrison was suffering agonies of thirst.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> On the 10th,
the last pool of water was drawn; and half a wine-glass
of the precious fluid was served out to each fighting man.
On the 11th there was not sufficient to serve out to the
whole party. At night they stole out with their <i>lotahs</i>
concealed under their clothes, lest the shining metal
should betray them, to snatch a few drops of water from
a neighbouring spring. But the enemy discovered the
practice, and shot down the wretched men. Parties were
then sent out to cover the water-carriers; but the soldiers,
mad with the tortures of thirst, quitted their ranks, and
could not be restrained from rushing forward in search of
the liquid life for which they had so long been languishing.
Every new effort to obtain water, however well devised,
failed from the same cause. The parties, which moved
out as disciplined soldiers, soon, in the madness of their
sufferings, became a disorderly rabble&mdash;soon were at the
mercy of the enemy, who shot them down, in their helplessness,
like sheep.</p>

<p>All hope was now at an end. The garrison were reduced
to a party of two hundred fighting men. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
had but thirty rounds of ammunition for each musket in
store. The wretched Goorkhas were literally perishing
with intolerable thirst. Pottinger and Haughton took
counsel together; and determined to make a desperate
effort to save the remnant of their little force by a rapid
unencumbered march to Caubul. Accordingly, on the
evening of the 13th of November, the Goorkhas evacuated
Charekur. Pottinger led the advance. Haughton had,
on the afternoon of that day, been disabled by a sabre-cut
from a jamadar of artillery, whilst apprehending a party
of deserters; and was now scarcely able to sit his horse.
Mr. Grant, a medical officer&mdash;not the first medical officer
who has played the part of the true soldier in battle, and
justified the claims of his profession to the soldier’s
honours and rewards&mdash;having spiked all the guns with
his own hands, led out the main body; whilst Ensign
Rose brought up the rear. The order of march was
soon lost. The little force became a disorderly rabble,
struggling on with the one object of allaying at the first
pool of water the torments of unendurable thirst. It was
impossible to keep them together&mdash;impossible to lead
them in safety to the capital. Pottinger and Haughton
were exhausted by the pain of their wounds. They could
render no service to their men; and would have perished
had they remained behind. So they determined on
pushing on to Caubul. A single sepoy of the Goorkha
corps, who plodded on with weary feet beside the horsemen,
Pottinger’s English writer, and the regimental <i>bunyah</i>,
were their only companions. The route was unknown to
them, and they had no guide; but they struggled on
through many difficulties and much danger, and at last
reached the neighbourhood of Caubul. Here the peril
thickened around them. Descending into the Caubul
plain behind the lake, and intending to cross the cultivated
ground to the cantonments, at the back of the Shah’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
garden, at Killa Bolundee, they missed the turning, and
soon found themselves in the midst of the enemy’s sentinels.
Fearing to attract attention by turning back, they then
made for Deh-Afghan, but finding the place occupied by
the enemy, and being closely challenged by the sentries,
they were compelled to pass into the city. Pursuing the
lanes and bazaars along the river bank, and narrowly
escaping death from a volley fired upon them by one of the
enemy’s picquets, they made their way at last to the cantonments.
The regiment in the mean while had perished.
Rose and Grant were slain by the enemy,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and scarcely a
man escaped to tell how his comrades had been miserably
destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>The intelligence brought in by Pottinger from the
Kohistan was not of a nature to rouse the drooping
spirits of the Envoy. Charekur had been lost; the
Goorkha regiment annihilated; and there were now
large bodies of Kohistanees and Nijrowees, having done
their bloody work at home, ready to join the insurgents
at the capital. With eager anxiety had Macnaghten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
been looking for the return of Sale’s brigade from Gundamuck,
and now he learnt, to his bitter disappointment,
that it had marched for Jellalabad. Still he did not
despair of being able to recall it. “We learn, to our
dismay,” he wrote to Macgregor on the 17th of November,
“that you have proceeded to Jellalabad. Our situation is
a desperate one if you do not immediately return to our
relief, and I beg that you will do so without a moment’s
delay. We have now been besieged for fourteen days, and
without your assistance are utterly unable to carry on any
offensive operations. You may easily make Caubul in
eight marches, and, as the Ghilzyes are here, you would
not have many enemies to contend with.”<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>In the course of the night he received a letter from
Macgregor, which satisfied him that there was no longer
any hope of receiving aid from Sale’s brigade. He had
begun to think by this time of the provisions of the
tripartite treaty, and to look for aid from the Sikhs.
“We are <i>in statu quo</i>,” he wrote to the same correspondent
on the following morning. “Our chief want is
supplies. I perceive now that you could not well have
joined us. I hope you have written to Mackeson, asking
him for aid from the Sikhs under the treaty. If there is
any difficulty about the Sikhs getting through the pass,
Mackeson should offer a bribe to the Khyburees of a lakh
of rupees, or more, to send them safe passage. These
are not times to stick at trifles.... It is raining here,
and the weather is very cold; but I am not sure that this
is not as bad for the enemy as for ourselves. I do not
hear anything from Ghuzni or Candahar, but I should not
wonder if they were in the same mess as ourselves. We
must look for support chiefly from Peshawur. Write to
Mackeson continually, and tell him to urge government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
to send as many troops into the country as speedily as
possible. John Conolly is in the Balla Hissar with his
Majesty, who, as you may imagine, is in a sad taking
about all the Fussad. I am making no progress in my
negotiations with the rebels.”<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The abandonment of all hope of assistance from Sale’s
brigade had now given a new complexion to the aspect
of affairs. The military authorities, who had been long
ripe for capitulation, now pressed the Envoy sorely with
their “distressful accounts of the state of the troops and
cattle from want of provisions,” and of the “hopelessness
of further resistance.”<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> But Macnaghten, though
he saw the necessity of weighing well the dangers that
beset the force, and the means of extricating it from its
perilous position, was not a man to grasp at the degradation
of surrender whilst yet there was a hope of rescuing
it by any more honourable course. The time had
come, however, for him to declare fully his sentiments to
the military commander; so, on the 18th of November,
he addressed to him a letter, in which the whole question
is thus reviewed, and which is too important in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
bearings upon our subsequent operations to warrant the
omission of a line:<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr4">Caubul, <i>18th Nov., 1841</i>.</p>
<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear General</span>,</p>

<p>The intelligence received last night from Captain Macgregor
makes it necessary that we should now take our future proceedings
into consideration. We have scarcely a hope of reinforcement from
Sale’s brigade. I would recommend we hold on here as long as
possible, and throughout the whole winter, if we can subsist the
troops by any means, by making the Mahomedans and Christians
live chiefly on flesh, and other contrivances. Here we have the
essentials of wood and water in abundance, and I believe our position
is impregnable.</p>

<p>A retreat in the direction of Jellalabad would be most disastrous,
and should be avoided, except in the last extremity; we shall be
better able to see, eight or ten days hence, whether that extremity
must be resorted to. In that case, we should have to sacrifice
the valuable property of government; we should have to sacrifice
his Majesty, who would not come away without his family; and
were we to make good our retreat to Jellalabad, we should find no
shelter for the troops (the cantonments being destroyed), and perhaps
no provisions. I fear, too, that in such a retreat very few of
our camp followers would survive. I have frequently thought of
negotiation, or rather capitulation, for such it would be, but in the
present unsettled state of affairs there is no authority possessing
sufficient weight to protect us all through the country; besides, we
should hardly be justified, even for the security of our persons and
property, to abandon even one position in the country. Another
alternative would be for us to retire to the Balla Hissar; but this,
I also fear, would be a disastrous retreat, and we should have to
sacrifice a vast deal of property. We probably should not succeed
in getting in our heavy guns, and they would be turned with effect
by the enemy against the citadel. We should neither have food,
nor firewood to cook it; for these essentials we should be dependent
upon sorties into the city, in which, if we were beaten, we should
of course be ruined.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, I think it best to hold on where we are as long
as possible, in the hope that something may turn up in our favour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
It is possible that we may receive reinforcements from Candahar.
Now that the cold weather is coming on, the enemy will disperse to
their houses very soon, and there will only be left the rebel chiefs
and their immediate followers. We should not, therefore, be
molested during the winter: and though circumstances make it
likely that we should be attacked soon if we are to be attacked
at all, a victory on our side might change the whole aspect of
affairs.</p>

<p>I was disposed to recommend that a decisive blow should be
struck somewhere to retrieve our fortunes, and that Mahomed
Khan’s fort should be captured. But I have since had reason to
believe no solid advantage, such as commanding the road to the
Balla Hissar, would result therefrom; that possibly we might not
be able to hold it; and, in short, that the benefit of the measure
would not counterbalance the risk attending it.</p>

<p>In eight or ten days more, we shall be better able to judge
whether there is any chance of an improvement in our position,
and, if not, it will remain for the military authorities to decide
whether it would be more prudent to attempt a retreat to Jellalabad,
or to retire into the Balla Hissar. If we could only bring in
sufficient provisions for the winter, I would on no account leave the
cantonment.</p>

<p class="pr6">Yours, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="pr"><span class="smcap">W. H. Macnaghten</span>.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Many and anxious, by this time, had been the discussions
relative to the abandonment of the cantonment, and
the concentration of the British troops in the Balla Hissar.
The measure had been recommended by the engineer,
Sturt, and others, very soon after the first outbreak of
the insurrection. The Envoy had favoured it at an earlier
as he did at a later, period of the siege; but he seems at
this time to have been more than usually alive to the
difficulties of the movement. The General had scarcely
any opinion at all on the subject. But the Brigadier
was resolutely opposed to it. His arguments were not
very overwhelming&mdash;but they were overwhelmingly advanced;
and he seems for some time to have borne down
the better reason of all who supported the measure. No
one in the whole force was more profoundly impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
with a conviction of the disadvantages of the cantonment
as a military position than Brigadier Shelton himself. He
has left on record, in emphatic language, his opinions upon
this point; but he could see in the extreme insecurity
of the cantonment an argument only for a discreditable
retreat. He could not see that if the extent of the cantonment-works
were such as to render their defence difficult,
and external operations on a large scale impossible, there
was in this circumstance abundant reason for the removal
of the force to a position cursed with none of these
annihilating evils.</p>

<p>In the Balla Hissar the troops would have been free
from molestation. They would not, as in cantonments,
have been harassed and dispirited by the necessity of
manning works exposed at every point to the attacks of
the enemy. They could have sallied out from such a
position in large bodies&mdash;have attacked the city and the
neighbouring forts&mdash;have obtained supplies from the surrounding
country&mdash;and held their own till the coming
spring. But against all this it was alleged that the
removal of the force from the cantonment to the Balla
Hissar would be a hazardous operation&mdash;that it could
not be accomplished without great loss, including, in all
probability, the entire sacrifice of the sick and wounded.
That the movement would not have been free from danger
is true. What movement could be free from danger, at
such a time?&mdash;what warlike operations ever are free from
danger? But that it would have necessarily involved the
total sacrifice of the sick and wounded, is only to be
assumed upon the hypothesis, that the curse which had
so long brooded over us would still have worked for our
own undoing, and that, therefore, no precautions would
have been taken to protect them.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Other arguments against the movement were also
adduced. It was said that there was a scarcity of firewood
in the Balla Hissar; and that there was no forage
for the horses. But to this it was replied that there
was a sufficiency of wood for purposes of cooking, that
more might be obtained by sallies into the city, and that
the improved shelter and increased comforts of the troops
in the Balla Hissar would, under the most unfavourable
circumstances, compensate for the want of firing. With
regard to the forage, it was replied, that, if the horses
could not be fed, they might be shot; and that there was
little need for the employment of cavalry in such a position
as the Balla Hissar.</p>

<p>One other argument, brought forward perhaps to give
respectability to the whole, was urged by Shelton and his
supporters. It was said that the abandonment of the cantonments
would have been an acknowledgment of defeat,
and a triumph to our enemies. It is enough to say of
this, that it was urged by men who were clamorous for an
abandonment, not of one position, but of all our positions
in Afghanistan, and a precipitate retreat from the country.
In the one case there might have been a partial triumph;
in the other there must have been a complete one.</p>

<p>And so, owing mainly to the pertinacity of Brigadier
Shelton, the only measure which could have saved the
British force from destruction, and the British name
from degradation, was rejected in this conjuncture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
The troops remained in cantonments, threatened by the
enemy and disheartened by the ominous gloom of their
own officers, only to sustain another and more crushing
defeat; and then to sink into a state of utter inactivity
and prostration, whilst the leaders of the enemy were
being brought over to consent to terms of capitulation,
humbling indeed to the pride of the proudest and most
successful nation of the world.</p>

<p class="p2">Whilst the feebleness of the military commanders in
cantonments had thus been playing away stake after stake,
until every hope of redemption was past, the King, shut
up in the Balla Hissar, had been watching the progress
of events with the profoundest anxiety and alarm. His
bearing was that of a man heartless and hopeless under
a pressure of unanticipated misfortunes; but prostrate
and imbecile as he was in this conjuncture, he could
see plainly enough the prostration and imbecility of the
British chiefs. When the commissariat fort fell into the
hands of the insurgents, the great calamity rose up suddenly
before the inmates of the Balla Hissar. From
the summit of the palace the enemy might be seen
throwing the plunder over the walls of the fort, to be
carried off by their companions below. There was a
general rush upwards to this commanding position to
witness the humiliating sight. The King beheld it with
deep emotion, and, painfully agitated, turned to the
Wuzeer and said, “Surely the English are mad.”<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Dejected as he was before, this crowning calamity
sunk him into a state of still deeper dejection. Every
report of the designs of the enemy, however incredible,
filled him with new terror. It was said that the insurgents
were running a mine from the Shor Bazaar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
under the very walls of the palace. Dreading an immediate
explosion, he quitted his apartments, and took
up his residence at the gate of the Harem, where, seated
at a window commanding an extensive view of the cantonments
and the surrounding country, he traced, through
a telescope, the progress of the exciting events passing
below. Day after day he sate at the same window,
looking down, from morning to evening prayer, upon a
scene which seldom yielded aught to comfort or reassure
him. Shah Soojah had never been a courageous man;
but he had always been a very proud one. That now,
enfeebled and desponding, he should have clung to any
support, turned anywhere for assistance, was not strange;
but when they saw the pompous and arrogant monarch
now so humbled and obsequious, laying aside all the
environments of royalty, to which before he had clung
with such pitiful tenacity, the English officers about
him felt that the shock must have been great indeed so
to revolutionise his whole nature. He made even the
British subalterns sit beside him on chairs; conversed
familiarly with them; enquired into their wants, and
condescended to supply them. “If,” said one who had
good opportunities of narrowly watching the behaviour
of the King at this time, “he is acting a part, he certainly
performs it admirably!”</p>

<p>Other reports soon came in from the city, or started up
in the Balla Hissar itself, still more to terrify the King.
It was alleged that the Arabs in the fort were about to
rise up in a body, to massacre the troops and to give the
place over to the rebels. The King, who never withheld
his belief from any story however improbable, seized the
chief of the Arab tribe, and ordered that no women
or children should be suffered to leave the fort. But
women and children of all kinds were now clamouring
for egress. Collecting in crowds before the Wuzeer’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
house, they importuned him, with loud lamentations, to
suffer them to depart. The Wuzeer appealed to the
King, who strictly prohibiting the egress of any Arab
families, suffered more than seven hundred other women
and children to pass out of the fort. The English officers
thought, that if all the Arabs and Afghans had been removed
from the fort, and all the provisions secured for
the use of the fighting men, the whole force might have
been saved.</p>

<p>The stores in the Balla Hissar had been indented
upon for the use of the cantonment force, and the
available supplies having been thus reduced, the troops
were put upon half rations. The departure, however,
of Brigadier Shelton and his escort had diminished the
number of the fighting men, and now, under Major
Ewart, they consisted of little more than the 54th N. I.,
a portion of the Horse Artillery troop under Captain
Nicoll, and some details of irregular troops. At the
points most exposed to attack the components of the
little garrison were posted, and, kept always on the alert
by reports of some threatened movement of the enemy,
were always ready to give them a warm reception.</p>

<p>The affair of the 13th of November struck a gleam of
hope into the garrison of the Balla Hissar. It seemed as
though new courage had been infused into the cantonment
force; and, as though to second the invigorated
efforts of their comrades, the artillerymen in the citadel
now began to ply their batteries with increased activity.
They shelled the city, and attempted to fire it with carcases;
but the houses were not of a construction to be
easily ignited, and the shelling produced little effect. The
residence of Ameen-oollah Khan, in the city, was to be
seen from the batteries; and the gunners, knowing the
old man to be one of our deadliest enemies, singled it out
as a mark, and poured their iron rain upon it. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
chief removed himself and his family to another house;
and the only slaughter was among the horses.</p>

<p>A crisis was now at hand in the fate of the cantonment
force. The 23rd of November was one of the most eventful
and the most disastrous in the history of the insurrection.
On that day a battle was fought which ended in the
disgraceful and calamitous defeat of the British troops.
The enemy had been for some time making their appearance
on the Beh-meru hill, and had repeatedly
descended into the village, whence the British commissariat
officers had been drawing supplies of grain. Irritated
by the assistance which the villagers had rendered
us, the insurgents had destroyed the houses, pillaged the
inhabitants, and attacked our commissariat people when
getting in their supplies. This was not to be endured.
Again the Envoy counselled the despatch of a strong
force to occupy the Beh-meru hill, and to dislodge the
enemy from a position in which they were able to work
us such grievous annoyance. Again the Brigadier objected.
Urging that the troops were exhausted and dispirited
by constant harassing duty on the ramparts, that
they had been living upon half-rations of parched wheat,
and were therefore physically as well as morally enfeebled,
he protested against a movement which he said
would have the effect of increasing the number of
wounded and sick, without leading to any solid advantage.
But these objections were overruled. On the
22nd a weak detachment had been sent out, under Major
Swayne, but it had only added another to our list of
failures. It was plain that something more must be
done. A council of war was held that evening at the
General’s quarters, and it was determined, after much
earnest discussion, on the special recommendation of the
Envoy, that a strong force should be sent out before
daybreak on the following morning, to occupy the Beh-meru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
hills. Shelton recommended that at the same time
an attack should be made on the village. It was urged
that the enemy would abandon the village as soon as
our troops occupied the hill. The Brigadier declared
that the occupation of the hill would only make the
enemy hold the village with greater pertinacity. Shelton’s
advice, however, was overruled. The force went
out before daybreak,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> took possession of the hill, and
posted themselves on the north-eastern extremity, which
overhung the village. With a fatuity only to be accounted
for by the belief that the curse of God was
upon those unhappy people, they had taken out a single
gun. This gun was now placed in a position commanding
an enclosure of the village, where the watch-fires
gave out their bright tokens that numbers of the
enemy were assembled. A shower of grape was presently
poured in upon the bivouac. Starting up in confusion,
the enemy gave back a volley from their jezails, but, abandoning
the open space, sought the shelter of the houses
and towers, and there exhausted their ammunition in a
vain attempt to respond to our grape and musketry. Day
dawned, and it was plain that the enemy were abandoning
the village. A few, however, still remained; and it was
determined to carry the place by assault. A storming
party was told off, under Major Swayne; but the village
was not carried. The detachment seems to have gone
down only to be fired at, and, after half an hour of
inactivity, was recalled by the Brigadier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>The movement of the British troops, even in the dim
twilight of the early morning, had been observed from
the city; and soon large bodies of the enemy were moving
across the plain. Horsemen and footmen streamed out
in thousands to give the Feringhees battle. The horsemen
stretched across the plain; the footmen covered an
opposite hill, and some reoccupied the village.</p>

<p>The fire from the enemy’s hill, which was separated
from that on which our own troops were posted only by
a narrow gorge, soon became hot and galling. Leaving
five companies at the extremity of the hill, immediately
above the village, Shelton took the remainder of his force,
with the one gun, over the gorge, to a position near the
brow of that hill, on which the enemy were assembling in the
greatest numbers. Here he formed his infantry into two
squares, and massed his cavalry immediately in their rear.
The one gun was nobly worked, and for a time, with
terrible effect, told upon the Afghan multitudes, who had
only a matchlock fire to give back in return. But thus
nobly worked, round after round poured in as quickly as
the piece could be loaded, it soon became unserviceable.
The vent was so heated by the incessant firing, that the
gunners were no longer able to serve it. Ammunition,
too, was becoming scarce. What would not those resolute
artillerymen have given for another gun? The firing
ceased; and the British musketeers were then left to do
their work alone. Little could they do, at such a time,
against the far-reaching Afghan matchlocks. The enemy
poured a destructive fire into our squares, but the muskets
of our infantry could not reach the assailants. The two
forces were at a distance from each other, which gave all
the advantage to the Afghans, who shot down our men
with ease, and laughed at the musket-balls, which never
reached their position.</p>

<p>The nature of the country was altogether unfavourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
to the British troops. Between them and the brow of
the hill there was some rising ground, which prevented
Shelton from seeing the movements of the enemy on the
side of the hill. But from the cantonment could be seen
a party of Afghans crawling from the gorge up the hill-side,
and rushing with sudden fury upon our infantry
masses. The unexpected attack seems to have struck a
panic into the heart of our troops, who turned and fled
along the ridge like sheep. Shelton, who ever in the
midst of danger stood with iron courage exposed to the
thickest fire of the enemy, vainly called upon his men to
charge. Not a man brought down his bayonet to the
position which the English soldier burns to assume when
he sees the enemy before him. The Afghans had planted
a standard upon the hill, only some thirty yards from the
British squares; and now an officer proclaimed a reward,
equal in the eyes of the common Sepoy to a year’s pay, to
any one who would advance and take it. But not a man
responded to the appeal. A great fear was upon them
all. The officers stood up like brave men; and hurled
stones at the advancing enemy.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> But nothing seemed to
infuse courage into our panic-struck troops. The enemy,
emboldened by success, advanced in larger numbers, and
rushed upon our single gun. Our cavalry, called upon to
charge, refused to follow their officers. The artillerymen
stood to their gun; two of them fell dead beside it; a
third was desperately wounded; a fourth, when the enemy
rushed upon it, clung to the carriage between the wheels,
and miraculously escaped destruction. There, too, fell
Lieutenant Laing, than whom there was not a braver soul
in the field on that fatal day, waving his sword over the
gun, cheering the men who were doing their duty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
calling on the rest to follow their example. But the
heroic courage of the officers was thrown away upon the
men. The gun was lost, and our disheartened regiments
were in confused and disastrous flight.</p>

<p>All, however, was not then lost. Shelton ordered the
halt to be sounded. The flying regiments stopped and
re-formed; then turning round, faced the enemy with a
shout, and seemed ready to renew the conflict. But the
Ghazees now shrunk from the British bayonets. They
were few in numbers; and they saw, too, a party of
Anderson’s Horse coming to the charge. Taking the
horses and limber with them, they abandoned the gun,
and fled.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the enemy’s cavalry on the plain had
been thrown into confusion by the fall of their leader&mdash;Abdoollah
Khan, Achetzkye. How he fell, or at what
moment, is not precisely known. It was generally believed
that he was wounded by a shot from our gun&mdash;but there
was a whisper, of doubtful credibility, to the effect that
he had been struck down by the jezail of one of his own
countrymen, who is said to have claimed a reward for the
act. Be the history of his fall what it may, it discouraged
and alarmed the Afghan cavalry on the plain. Seeing
their leader carried from the field, they fled in confusion
towards the city. Ignorant of the cause of their flight,
the infantry began to follow them; and the excited
lookers-on in cantonments now thought the day was ours.
Macnaghten and Elphinstone were standing together on
the ramparts watching the enemy as they streamed across
the plain. The opportunity seemed a great one. To
have sent out of cantonments a body of troops to pursue
the flying enemy, and render their confusion complete,
would have been to have secured a victory. The Envoy
urged it upon the General; but the General said it was a
wild scheme, and weakly negatived the worthy proposal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment, when the enemy were in flight,
and our gun had been recaptured, Shelton might have
brought back his force with credit to cantonments. But
the opportunity was lost. The enemy returned to the
field, recruited by new hordes whom they met emerging
from the city; and soon the swelling multitude poured
itself upon our battalions. The General had sent out
new supplies of ammunition, with another limber and
horses for the gun; and it was soon again in full operation,
playing with murderous effect upon the masses of
the enemy. But again the British muskets were found
no match for the Afghan jezails. There were truer eyes
and steadier hands, too, in the ranks of the enemy than
in our own; and now with unerring aim the Afghan
marksmen mowed down our men like grass. The artillery
men were falling fast at their gun; and Shelton,
thinking it insecure, withdrew it to a safer position.
Emboldened by this, the enemy continued the attack
with increased vigour; and again the British troops began
to cower beneath the fire of their assailants.</p>

<p>For now was seen again that spectacle which had
before struck terror into our ranks and scattered our
fighting men like sheep. A party of the enemy, headed
by a band of furious Ghazees, emerged from the gorge,
and crawling up the hill suddenly burst upon our wavering
battalions. The British troops had been losing heart
before this; and now it needed little to extinguish the
last remaining spark of courage that warmed them. At
this inauspicious moment, Shelton, who had been ever in
the thickest of the fire, and who escaped by very miracle
the balls which flew about the one-armed veteran, and
struck him five times with no effect, fell back a few
paces to order some more men to the front. Seeing
the back of their commander turned towards the enemy,
our front rank men gave way; and, in a minute, infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
and cavalry were flying precipitately down the slope of
the hill. The Afghan horse, seizing the opportunity,
dashed upon our retreating force; and presently friend
and foe were mixed up in inextricable confusion. The
artillerymen alone were true to themselves and their
country. Thinking only of the safety of their gun, they
dashed down the steep descent and drove into the very
midst of the Afghan horsemen. But they could not
resist the multitudes that closed around them; and the
gun, so nobly served and so nobly protected, fell a second
time into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>The rout of the British force was complete.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In one
confused mass of infantry and cavalry&mdash;of European
and native soldiers&mdash;they fled to the cantonment walls.
Elphinstone, who had watched the conflict from the
ramparts, went out, infirm as he was, and strove, with
all the energy of which, in his enfeebled state, he was
master, to rally the fugitives. But they had lost themselves
past recovery; they had forgotten that they were
British soldiers. The whole force was now at the mercy
of the Afghans. Had they swept on, the cantonments
must have fallen before them. The enemy were so
mixed up with our men, that the guns on the ramparts
could not open upon them without destroying our retreating
battalions. But the insurgents made no effort to
follow up the advantage they had gained. One of the
chiefs, Osman Khan, Barukzye, suddenly drew off his men,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and, in a short time, the whole force, after savagely mutilating
the corpses of our slain, had withdrawn, with shouts
of exultation to the city.</p>

<p>“This,” says Brigadier Shelton, in his narrative of the
events, in which he bore so conspicuous a part, “concluded
all exterior operations.”<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Nothing more was to
be done by fighting. A general gloom hung over the
cantonment. The most sanguine now began to despond.
The troops had not only lost all heart&mdash;they had lost all
discipline. The link which bound them to their officers
seemed to be broken. The privations to which they
were exposed were great. Cold, hunger, and fatigue
pressed upon them; and they had not strength to bear
up against such a burden of woe. It was plain that no
use could be made in the field of a force so feeble and
dispirited. The time for action had passed. And so,
when, on the day after this disastrous affair on the Beh-meru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
hill, the enemy began to destroy the bridge which
General Elphinstone, a short time before, had thrown over
the Caubul River, the military chiefs looked idly on,
whilst this outrage was being perpetrated almost within
musket-shot of our position.</p>

<p>There were only two courses now open to the doomed
force; and the political and military chiefs began again
to take counsel together. The question of concentration
in the Balla Hissar was first revived and discussed between
them. John Conolly, at the instance of the King,
wrote urgently to Macnaghten, recommending the measure
as the only one that could now secure the safety and the
honour of the British troops. But the military authorities
had set their faces against it, and the Envoy yielded his
assent to their opinions against his own better judgment.
After a personal interview, on the morning of the 24th of
November, at which the subject had been discussed
between them, General Elphinstone addressed the following
letter to the Envoy, seeking Macnaghten’s opinion
and stating his own:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr4"><i>24th Nov., 1841.</i></p>
<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir William</span>,</p>

<p>With reference to our conversation this morning, I request
you will let me know what are your views with respect to moving
into the Balla Hissar as proposed to you, admitting the possibility
of our holding out there. Our getting into it with our ammunition
and numerous sick and wounded, amounting to near 700, would be
attended with the greatest difficulty, if not be altogether impossible.
The enemy, no doubt, in the greatest force would oppose us,
which would oblige us to cover the operation with the greatest part
of our troops, and thereby leave the cantonment without sufficient
defence.</p>

<p>I am the more confirmed in my opinion of the difficulty of the
operation from the harassed and dispirited state of our troops, now
so much reduced in numbers, and failure would tend to our certain
destruction. With our means, it would take some days to remove
the ammunition and stores, during which the enemy would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
collecting a great number around us; our wounded would be increased,
with diminished means of conveying them.</p>

<p>Would the Balla Hissar hold us with our followers, even after
the sacrifice of our horses and cattle? I am told that water is
already selling there at a high price, even with the present small
garrison. We have, at best, barely twenty days’ supplies, which,
even if we could remove, we have little prospect of adding to at the
Balla Hissar; a retreat from thence would be worse than from our
present position, for after abandoning our horses and means of
transport, our sick, wounded, and stores, would have to be left
behind at the mercy of the enemy.</p>

<p>I have conferred with Brigadier Shelton, the second in command,
and he concurs with me in the above opinion.</p>

<p class="pr6">Yours, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="pr"><span class="smcap">W. K. Elphinstone</span>.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">To this letter the Envoy replied:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">My dear General</span>,</p>

<p>In reply to your note just received, I beg to state my opinion
that the move into the Balla Hissar would be attended with the
greatest difficulty, and I do not see what advantage could accrue
therefrom, although the disadvantages, as pointed out by you, are
apparent in the event of our ultimate retreat. As to the mere
question of room for our troops and followers, I do not imagine
that we should feel much difficulty on that account.</p>

<p class="pr6">Yours, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">W. H. Macnaghten</span>.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">The question of a movement into the Balla Hissar
having been thus disposed of for the present, the Envoy
turned his thoughts towards that other course, which had
been so long pressed upon him by the military chief. He
began to think of negotiating with the enemy. But that
he might not, save in the last extremity, enter upon a line
of conduct against which the manliness of his nature revolted,
he addressed a letter to the General, asking, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
specific terms, whether he considered it possible any longer
to maintain his position in the country. To this letter
Elphinstone replied:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr4"><i>Caubul, 24th Nov., 1841.</i></p>
<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of this day’s date, calling for my opinion as to whether, in a military
point of view, it is feasible any longer to maintain our position
in this country.</p>

<p>In reply, I beg to state, that after having held our position here
for upwards of three weeks in a state of siege, from the want of
provisions and forage, the reduced state of our troops, the large
number of wounded and sick, the difficulty of defending the extensive
and ill situated cantonment we occupy, the near approach of
winter, our communications cut off, no prospect of relief, and the
whole country in arms against us, I am of opinion that it is not
feasible any longer to maintain our position in this country, and
that you ought to avail yourself of the offer to negotiate which has
been made to you.</p>

<p class="pr"><span class="smcap">W. K. Elphinstone.</span><a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Upon the receipt of this letter the Envoy ceased to
hesitate. The enemy had made pacific overtures to him,
and he now believed that it was no longer his duty to
refuse to listen to them. So he sent a message to the
insurgent chiefs, intimating his willingness to receive a
deputation from them, and to discuss the preliminaries
of a treaty. The invitation was accepted. On the following
day, Sultan Mahomed Khan, Barukzye, and
Meerza Ahmed Ali, Kuzzilbash, made their appearance
at the bridge. Nothing could have been more unassuming
than the ambassadorial cortège. The deputies
rode sorry horses, and were attended only by their
grooms. Captain Lawrence and Captain Trevor were
sent out to meet them. The conference lasted two hours.
Sultan Mahomed Khan, whose tone was insolent and
uncompromising, demanded terms such as the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
officers could not listen to without disgrace. The deputies
then asked to see Macnaghten, and the party moved
to cantonments. In the guard-room at one of the
gateways the Envoy received the Afghan ambassadors.
The discussion was long and animated. Sultan Mahomed,
still arrogant and offensive, trode down, as with the
heel of the conqueror, all the pretensions of his opponents;
and declared that, as the Afghans had beaten us
in battle, they had a right to dictate terms of capitulation.
He demanded that the British should surrender
at discretion, giving themselves up with all their arms,
ammunition, and treasure, as prisoners of war. Macnaghten
was not a man to submit to this dictation.
The terms were resolutely rejected. “We shall meet,
then,” said Sultan Mahomed, “on the field of battle.”
“At all events,” replied Macnaghten, “we shall meet at
the day of judgment.” And so the conference was brought
to an end.</p>

<p>Then the Envoy sent them in writing a statement of
the only terms on which he was prepared to treat. “I
proposed to them,” he subsequently recorded, “the only
terms which, in my opinion, could be accepted with
honour; but the temper of the rebels may best be understood
when I mention that they returned me a letter of
defiance the next morning, to the effect that unless I consented
to surrender our arms and abandon his Majesty to
his fate, we must prepare for immediate hostilities. To
this I replied, that we preferred death to dishonour, and
that it would remain with a higher power to decide between
us.”<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>Thus ended the first attempt to secure, by negotiation
with the enemy, the safety of our discomfited troops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Whilst this movement was in progress a strange sight
might have been seen on the ramparts of the British
cantonment. Over those low walls, misnamed defences,
the European soldiers were conversing with their Afghan
enemies. The Afghans, armed to the teeth, came clustering
round the cantonments; many of our soldiers went
out unarmed amongst them, and were to be seen familiarly
shaking hands with those whom a day before they had
met on the field of battle. The Afghans were giving
vegetables<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> to the men of the 44th Regiment, and declaring
that everything had been amicably settled between
the two contending hosts.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">[November&mdash;December: 1841.]</p>

<p class="pch">Progress of Negotiation&mdash;Arrival of Mahomed Akbar Khan&mdash;His Character&mdash;Negotiations
continued&mdash;Deaths of Meer Musjedee and
Abdoollah Khan&mdash;Revival of Negotiations&mdash;The Draft Treaty.</p>


<p><span class="beg">A new</span> actor now appeared upon the stage. The advent
of Mahomed Akbar Khan had been for some time expected.
He had arrived from Toorkistan early in October,
and was known to have been hovering about Bameean,
and seemingly watching the progress of events in the
neighbourhood of the Afghan capital. How far he may
have sown the seeds of insurrection among the Ghilzyes
is not very clearly known, but it is probable that the
influence he exercised at that time was rather of a passive
than of an active kind. That his presence on the borders
of Afghanistan encouraged his countrymen in their career
of hostility is not to be doubted; but there is little or no
evidence to connect him more palpably with the earlier
movements of the insurrectionary war. Whatever may
have been his participation in the events of October and
November, his appearance at the capital was now hailed
by the insurgents with every demonstration of delight.
Salutes were fired in honour of his arrival, and the chiefs
waited upon him as upon one henceforth to be recognised
as their leader. He was known to be a man of high
courage and energy; he had approved himself a good
soldier in the field; and he was the favourite son of the
old Barukzye ruler, who a year before had been condemned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
to pine away the remainder of his life a captive in the
provinces of Hindostan.</p>

<p>The arrival of the Sirdar was a great event. Both
parties looked upon it as one that must exercise a mighty
influence over the future destinies of the war. The
insurgents, wanting a leader, saw in the son of Dost
Mahomed one around whom they could rally, with confidence
alike in his sincerity and his courage. He had the
wrongs of an injured family to redress. He had a kingdom
to regain. He had been an outcast and a fugitive during
two years of suffering and danger, because it had pleased
the British government to invade his father’s dominions and
to expel the <i>de facto</i> rulers of the country; and now he
saw opening out before him a prospect of recovering the
lost supremacy of the Barukzyes, and restoring his exiled
father to the Balla Hissar. All the circumstances of his
past life and his present position were such as to secure
his loyalty to the national cause. His inner qualities, no
less than his outer environments, were of a class to rivet
his hostility to the British. He was a man of an eager,
impetuous nature; susceptible of good and of bad impulses,
but seldom otherwise than earnest and impulsive.
His education had been neglected; in his youth he had
been unrestrained, and now self-control&mdash;a virtue rarely
exercised by an Afghan&mdash;was wholly foreign to the
character of the man. He was, indeed, peculiarly demonstrative,
and sudden in his demonstrations, passing
rapidly from one mood to another&mdash;blown about by
violent gusts of feeling, bitterly repenting to-day the
excesses of yesterday, and rushing into new excesses to-morrow.
His was one of those fiery temperaments&mdash;those
bold, dashing characters&mdash;which, in times of popular
commotion, ever place their possessor in the front rank.
But in seasons of repose he was one of the most joyous
and light-hearted of men; no man loved a joke better;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
no man laughed more heartily, or seemed to look more
cheerfully on the sunny side of life. They, who knew
him before the British trode down the Barukzyes, spoke
of him as a good-tempered, well-meaning young man, and
little thought, when his large dark eyes were glowing
with child-like eagerness, to have the full dimensions of
his long spear introduced into his portrait; or his solid
frame was shaking with laughter at some joke passed
upon his uncomely <i>Meerza</i>, that he would soon become
the chief actor in one of the bloodiest tragedies that has
ever disgraced the history of the world.</p>

<p>Whilst the Afghans, with noisy demonstrations of
delight, were welcoming the appearance of Akbar Khan,
the British were slow to believe that his advent would
deepen the embarrassments of their position. Early in
November, Mohun Lal had suggested to Macnaghten the
expediency of endeavouring to corrupt the Sirdar before
his advance upon the capital; but the Envoy had received
slightingly the proposal, and no overtures had
been made to the son of Dost Mahomed before his arrival
at the capital. It was believed that there was sufficient
security for his forbearance in the fact that so many members
of his family were prisoners in our hands; and in the
game of negotiation, which was now to be carried on, it
was calculated that the intervention of the Sirdar would
facilitate rather than encumber our arrangements for the
honourable evacuation of Afghanistan, and our safe return
to the provinces which, in an evil hour, we had been so
unhappily tempted to quit.</p>

<p>Akbar Khan appeared at Caubul; but he did not at
once assume the direction of affairs. The Newab Mahomed
Zemaun Khan, a cousin of the late Caubul chief,
had been proclaimed King by the insurgents. All orders
were sent forth in his name; and the “fatiha” was read
for him in the mosques. He was a man of a humane and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
honourable nature, polished manners, and affable address.
His nephew, Osman Khan, who is described by the Envoy
as “the most moderate and sensible man” of the insurgent
party, was now employed to negotiate with the
British minister, and several times passed, on this errand,
between the cantonment and the city. But the terms still
dictated by the enemy were such as Macnaghten could
not honourably accept. Day followed day; and nothing
effectual was done either in council or on the field. The
enemy appeared on the hills commanding the cantonments
and in the village of Beh-meru, now deserted and destroyed;
and the guns in the British cantonments were
playing all day long upon these points. But such distant
interchanges produced no result; and in the meanwhile
our provisions were rapidly dwindling down. Again
starvation stared the garrison in the face. With laudable
zeal and activity the commissariat officers exerted themselves
to obtain grain from the surrounding country; but
with equal zeal and activity the enemy were striving to
frustrate their efforts. Akbar Khan himself had not been
many days at Caubul before he began to see that to defeat
our commissariat officers was to overcome our unhappy
force. Threatening death to all who might be detected
in supplying our troops with any description of food, he
soon baffled the best efforts of Boyd and Johnson, and
again brought the question of capitulation to a simple
question of supplies.</p>

<p>But still sanguine and confident, whilst the clouds were
gathering more and more thickly around him, Macnaghten
saw the skies brightening over-head, and never doubted
that before long the storm would roll itself away. The
letters which he wrote at this time present a remarkable
contrast to those written by General Elphinstone. Whilst
the General was looking around him everywhere for whatever
could be made to swell the mountain of difficulty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
danger that he kept so steadily before him, the Envoy was
constantly arraying in the foreground every circumstance
that could in any way contribute towards the chance of
ultimate success. Whilst the General was discovering
that “our position was becoming more and more critical,”
the Envoy was perceiving that “our prospects were
brightening,” and talking about “defying the whole of
Afghanistan.” On the 28th of November, General
Elphinstone wrote to Sir William Macnaghten, commenting
on the wants and sufferings of the troops, and
asking what effect the death of Abdoollah Khan would
have upon their prospects: “Between ourselves,” he said,
in conclusion, “I see nothing we can do but by negotiation,
if such be offered, and which for the many
difficulties we are surrounded with, I hope may be the
case.”</p>

<p>Very different from the tone of this desponding letter
was the spirit which at this time animated the communications
of the Envoy to Mohun Lal. But there are other
points besides the sanguine temperament of Macnaghten
which his letters to the Moonshee tend painfully to illustrate:
“The intelligence you have sent me is very encouraging,”
he wrote on the 26th of November, “and I hope
the <i>nifac</i> among the rebels will increase. Meer Musjedee’s
death will probably cause the dispersion of the rebels who
have come from Nijrow. Humza Khan never sent any
relatives of the Ghilzye chiefs to me. Tell everybody
that I have no faith in Sultan Mahomed Khan, and that
I only wished to try the sincerity of his employers.”
And again, on the 29th, he wrote, “We are well off for
everything but supplies, and, <i>Inshalla</i>, we shall not be
badly off for them.... The enemy appeared to-day in
considerable numbers, but they did nothing, and I am
sure they will never venture to attack our cantonment.
If we had only provisions, which, with due exertions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
ought to be obtained, we should be able to defy the whole
of Afghanistan for any period. I am very sorry that the
deputation from Humza did not make their appearance
last night, and I am anxiously expecting accounts from
you showing why they did not do so.” On the following
day the Envoy added a postscript to this letter, saying,
“Our prospects are, I think, brightening, and if you can
assist us in the way of supplies, we have nothing to fear<span class="ls1">....</span>
I would give any money to Humza and the
Ghilzyes if I had any security that they would be our
friends, give us supplies, and keep open the communications.”</p>

<p>It will be gathered from these passages, as from others
before quoted, that Macnaghten, employing Mohun Lal
as his agent, was endeavouring to secure the assistance of
different hostile tribes by bribing them with money and
with promises. He knew that there is no stronger passion
than avarice in an Afghan’s breast. But he did not turn
his knowledge to profitable account. Had it been possible
to deal with the Afghans as one united body, and to have
corrupted them, <i>en masse</i>, with a few lakhs of rupees, he
might have bought the safety of the force. But to bribe
one party was to raise the hopes of another; and the
representative of each conflicting clan believed that the
amount of money he would receive would be measured
by the force of his antagonism. As soon, therefore, as it
was known that the money-bags of the Feringhees were
being opened, and that indulgences were being bought,
every one, eager to clutch the largest possible amount of
purchase-money, increased the pressure of his hostility
and rose in his demands. And thus the very measures by
which Macnaghten sought to extricate himself from his
difficulties, only made them gather more menacingly
around him.</p>

<p>It will be gathered also from these letters, that, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the end of November, Abdoollah Khan and Meer Musjedee
had both been removed by death, from the scene of
their recent triumphs. General Elphinstone speaks of
the death of the former; Sir William Macnaghten of the
death of the latter. In the action of the 23rd of
November, Abdoollah Khan had been carried wounded
from the field of battle; but whether a shrapnel shot
from Shelton’s one gun, or a ball from an Afghan jezail,
struck down the truculent chief, is a point of history
which must ever remain, as now, enveloped in obscurity
and doubt. The story runs, that one of the men who had
been set upon the track of the doomed chiefs, declared
that he shot down his victim from behind a wall; and
promised that poison should complete the work which
the bullet had but partially effected. Abdoollah Khan
died before a week had expired;<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> and it is said that
Abdool Aziz claimed the price of blood. But Mohun
Lal did not feel assured that either the traitorous bullet
or the poison of the claimant had done the work of
death; and the reward was refused on the plea that it
had been offered for the heads of the chiefs, and the head
of Abdoollah Khan had not been brought to him.</p>

<p>How Meer Musjedee died is not very clearly known.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
His disappearance from the scene on which he had acted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
so conspicuous a part, was sudden and unexpected. A
man named Mahomed Oollah swore that he had suffocated
the chief in his sleep, and claimed the reward of his service.
But the reward, it is said, was refused upon the
same plea as was urged in the other case. The assassins,
disappointed of their blood-money, were not likely to
undertake any future service of the same hazardous kind,
or to maintain a very discreet silence about the past. If
they were employed upon such service, it is strange that
their silence was not secured by a scrupulous fulfilment of
the engagement by which their suborners had placed their
own credit and safety in their hands. It was a perilous
game, indeed, to invite disclosures by exciting the anger and
hostility of the agents employed in this miserable work.</p>

<p>There is much obscurity still enveloping all this portion
of the history of the war in Afghanistan. It is certain
that at the end of November, Meer Musjedee and Abdoollah
Khan died under circumstances which have been
regarded, and not unreasonably, as suspicious. It is
scarcely less certain that Lieutenant John Conolly, the
cousin and assistant of the Envoy, instigated Mohun Lal
to offer rewards for the heads of certain of the insurgent
chiefs, and that Meer Musjedee and Abdoollah Khan were
especially marked as the first victims. John Conolly was at
this time with Shah Soojah in the Balla Hissar, and Mohun
Lal was in the house of the Kuzzilbash chief. The Envoy
was in the cantonments. To what extent John Conolly
acted under Macnaghten’s instructions&mdash;whether he acted
on his own authority, or was directed by Shah Soojah, is
not very clearly known. That Conolly was in constant
communication with the Envoy we have the authority of
the latter for believing. “Throughout the rebellion,” he
wrote, in his official report, “I was in constant communication
with the Shah through my assistant, Lieutenant
J. B. Conolly, who was in attendance on his Majesty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the Balla Hissar.” It has been questioned, therefore,
whether Conolly, being at this time in constant communication
with the Envoy, was likely, in a matter of so much
responsibility, to have acted without instructions from
his chief. But, on the other hand, we have Macnaghten’s
specific declaration that it was never his object to encourage
the assassination of the insurgents: “I am sorry,” he
wrote on the 1st of December to Mohun Lal, “to find from
your letter of last night that you should have supposed it
was ever my object to encourage assassination. The rebels
are very wicked men, but we must not take unlawful
means to destroy them.”<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> In addition to this written declaration,
we have the statement of Captain Skinner, to
the effect that, when at a subsequent period the murder
of Ameen-oollah was suggested to him by Akbar Khan, the
Envoy shrank with abhorrence and disgust from the proposal,
“assuring the ambassadors that, as a British functionary,
nothing would induce him to pay a price for
blood.”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Against the specific written declaration of the Envoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
himself that it was never his object to encourage assassination,
coupled with the evidence of Captain Skinner, to the
effect that he revolted at the very suggestion, there is
nothing but bare presumption to be opposed. If presumption
is to carry weight with it, in so grave a discussion as this,
it may fairly be presumed that a man of a nature so humane,
and of instincts so honourable, would not have encouraged
or sanctioned the foul trade of secret murder, and peremptorily
denied his approval of measures which he had
himself originated or supported. But if he had been utterly
destitute both of humanity and truth, it would still be
incredible that, having encouraged the assassination of the
chiefs, he should have boldly denied it to the very man whom,
directly or indirectly, he had employed to hire the assassins.</p>

<p>On a question so grave and solemn as this, it is to be
lamented that the judgment of the historian, after all conflicting
evidence has been weighed and sifted, should be
merely of an inferential character. The inference is, that
whilst not wholly ignorant of the offers of head-money,
which John Conolly, living with, and probably acting under
the directions of Shah Soojah, was putting forth, through
the agency of Mohun Lal, the Envoy neither suggested,
nor actively encouraged, these “bloody instructions,” on
which such severe comments have been passed. It has
been seen that he was prepared to offer rewards in the
name of the King, for the apprehension of the principal
rebels; and in the heat and excitement of active warfare,
it is hardly probable that, if these men had been apprehended,
their offences would have been subjected to a fair
and impartial judicial inquiry. Macnaghten, indeed, stated
that he would recommend his Majesty to “execute them.”
Such passive complicity as this, when all the circumstances
by which Macnaghten was environed are fairly
estimated, cannot be severely censured. We can only
arrive at a just decision, in a case of so unprecedented a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
character as this, by weighing well all the difficulties which
surrounded, all the responsibilities that weighed upon, and
all the temptations that beset the Envoy. If so surrounded,
so weighed upon, so beset, he did not actively
interfere to arrest the questionable measures of others,
which seemed to offer some means of escape from the perils
which hemmed in the British army&mdash;an army fearfully
sacrificed by the feebleness of the military chiefs&mdash;I confess
that I cannot see that he yielded more readily to
temptation than any other man of high honour would have
done, when begirt with such fiery trial.</p>

<p>But it is a relief to turn aside from the consideration of
such a question, even to the record of the imbecility of our
military leaders and the sufferings of our unhappy troops.&mdash;On
the 1st of December there were supplies for barely
eight days’ consumption in store. The camp-followers
were receiving half a pound of barley a day. The
cattle were without provender. It was necessary to keep
them from absolute starvation by supplying them with
the twigs, the lighter branches, and the bark of trees.
Some small quantities of wheat were taken from the troops
to feed the cattle used in the guns. In this conjuncture,
Elphinstone, who met every difficulty more than half way,
and who was not likely, therefore, to be silent at such a
time as this, wrote on the 1st of November, to the Envoy,
saying that there was no Boosa (bran), for the cattle, and
that they had been obliged to give the mountain-train
yaboos some wheat to keep them alive. “I hope, therefore,”
he added, “your negotiation may prosper, as circumstances
are becoming extremely critical; little has
been done in the way of purchase this morning. I don’t
wish to croak, but think it right that you should be kept
constantly informed of the real state of things. Sixty-five
maunds is all that has been got in to-day; twelve
maunds yesterday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>On the same day, Captain Johnson impressed upon
the Envoy that there was no time to be lost&mdash;that if a
retreat on Jellalabad were to be determined upon, it
should be determined upon at once, as it would be
necessary to take provisions for five days with the retreating
force. The Envoy assented to this; but, ever eager
to clutch at any hope, however slender, of deferring the
dreadful day of surrender, he added, “Let us wait two
days longer&mdash;something may turn up.”</p>

<p>The two days passed, and nothing turned up. So the
military authorities continued to press upon the Envoy,
with oft-repeated urgent recommendations, for a speedy
conclusion of a treaty with the enemy, enabling the
British troops in safety to evacuate the country. But
still the Envoy clung to the hope that something might
be evolved in our favour; and delayed, in spite of their
importunities from day to day, the dreadful hour of surrender.
The General knew that his troops were not to be
trusted. The Envoy knew this equally well; but, more
jealous of the honour of his country, more hopeful and
more courageous, he was unwilling to fling away a single
chance which the wheel of time might throw up in his
favour. In that great chapter of accidents, however, to
which he so bravely turned, were written down only
further disasters and degradations. On the 5th of December,
the enemy, in open day, burnt the bridge which
the English had thrown over the Caubul River, a quarter
a mile from the cantonments. On the day after the
calamitous action of the 23rd of November, the insurgents
had begun to destroy it, and now they completed the
work of destruction. They burnt it exultingly before the
faces of our troops, who were lining the ramparts and
looking idly on, as though there were no dishonour in
endurance. The bridge was of little use at that season
of the year, for the stream was fordable&mdash;but it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
burning disgrace to the military authorities, that with
5000 British troops at their command, and with the
ramparts of the cantonments bristling with guns, they
should have suffered such an insult as this to be flung in
their face.</p>

<p>The following day was one also of humiliation. Mahomed
Sheriff’s fort, which was garrisoned by a party
of European and Native troops, was abandoned on the
6th of December. The enemy, a day or two before, had
endeavoured to blow open the gate with powder-bags, but
had not succeeded in the attempt. They might have
spared themselves the trouble of the effort and the discredit
of the failure. On the 6th of December, a very
small party of the enemy, unperceived by the garrison,
contrived to climb up the walls of the fort, from the direction
of the King’s garden. They had no sooner shown
their heads at the window of the room where our men
were sitting, than both Europeans and natives, panic-struck
and bewildered, escaped over the opposite wall,
and, abandoning their bedding, arms, and ammunition, fled
into the cantonments.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> The fort was soon filled with the
enemy. Not an effort was made to recapture it.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
guns on the ramparts played upon it all day long, and
before evening one of the bastions crumbled to pieces
under our fire; but the British troops remained inactive
in the cantonments, submitting patiently to every new
insult, as though disgrace, now become habitual, had
ceased to be a burden to them.</p>

<p>Another blot was, at the same time, fixed upon the
character of the unhappy troops. The 44th Queen’s
regiment had supplied the details of the guard for the
protection of the cantonment bazaar. They were now
withdrawn under circumstances little calculated to raise
the reputation of the corps; and some companies of the
37th Native Infantry were sent to relieve them. A brief
letter on this subject, from the General to the Envoy,
supplies a painful commentary on the state of the troops
at this time. “Three companies of the 37th,” wrote
Elphinstone, “have been ordered into the bazaar as a
guard for it. Shelton wishes a support of the 44th outside.
If they have any sense of shame left, they must do
better, and their officers <i>must exert</i> themselves. S. is
disposed to attribute the blame to the Sepoys&mdash;from all
I hear, I fear unjustly; but this must be inquired into
when we have time.”</p>

<p>While the troops were thus, day after day, becoming
more and more demoralised and incapable, under the
destroying influence of feeble and fatuous command, the
General and the Envoy were in correspondence and communication
relative to the course to be followed for the
salvation of the British army and the British honour.
The General wrote what none knew better than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Envoy, that provisions had become miserably scarce, and
that he could not see how, if they continued to hold out,
they could possibly escape starvation. The Civilian
replied that as, if they abandoned their position, they
could not carry with them more than two days’ supplies,
and that there were then, on the 5th of December, nine
days’ supplies, on half rations, there was no occasion for
an immediate decision. He still hung upon the skirts of
fortune, hoping that something might be written down, in
the great chapter of accidents, in our favour. The thought
of retreat was intolerable to him. All, he believed, even
if no reinforcements came from Candahar, might yet be
saved by a vigorous effort to concentrate the troops in the
Balla Hissar. A retreat on Jellalabad, without terms, he
declared to be impracticable. And if practicable, he said,
it would “cover us with everlasting infamy.” Still
believing in the fidelity of the King, and still, with all
the generosity and the delicacy of a high-minded English
gentleman, resolute not to sacrifice the interests or the
honour of his Majesty, he pointed out that they could
not take the King’s family with them, and that Shah
Soojah would not stir without them. The internal
jealousies and animosities of the chiefs rendered a retreat,
under terms that would be respected, equally impracticable.
So the Envoy contended that the only alternative
which remained, and that the most safe as it was the most
honourable, was to send the sick and wounded under cover
of the night to the Balla Hissar, and then, having
destroyed all the ordnance and stores that they could not
take with them, to fight their way to the citadel.</p>

<p>Having written this to the General, Macnaghten visited
him, and again urged his opinion, with equal earnestness
in oral discourse. Another project suggested itself to Macnaghten.
Might it not be possible to obtain provisions by
force from some of the surrounding villages? A night-attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
might be made on Deh-Hadjee, or a similar enterprise
undertaken against Killa Bolundee. But the
General had no taste for night attacks or enterprises of any
kind. He was full only of objections. The Envoy took
his departure, disappointed and dispirited, and soon afterwards
received a letter from Elphinstone, arraying a
host of obstacles to the success of all the suggested efforts
for the maintenance of the national honour, and staggering
at last to the conclusion that there was nothing to be
done but to enter into what he called “honourable
terms.”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>And now matters were at their worst. To what depths
of humiliation our unhappy force had sunk, and with what
indignation the Envoy regarded a state of things which
he was powerless to avert or to remedy, a letter, written
about this time to Captain Macgregor, painfully declares.
“Our troops,” wrote Macnaghten, “are behaving like
a pack of despicable cowards, and there is no spirit
or enterprise left amongst us. The military authorities
want me to capitulate, but this I am anxious to put off to
the last moment. In the mean time we shall soon have
to come to some decision, as we have only three days’ provision
for our troops, and nothing for our cattle. We are
anxiously looking out for reinforcements from Candahar.
We have rumours of their approach, but nothing as yet
authentic.”</p>

<p>But the direst peril was that of starvation, which had
now become imminent. The wretched camp-followers were
living upon the carcases of the camels which had been
starved to death. The trees in cantonments had been
stripped of all their bark and light branches to supply
provender to the cattle, and were now all bare and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
useless. The commissariat officers, Boyd and Johnson,
wrote a joint letter to the General, stating that, after much
fruitless exertion, they had been compelled to adopt the
opinion that provisions were no longer obtainable by
purchase. It was their duty, they said, “to report, from
personal knowledge of the country to the north or north-east
of cantonments, the utter impossibility of obtaining,
either by force or otherwise, the smallest quantity of grain
or forage of any kind within a distance of from three to
four miles; and, further, that within this space the whole
of the forts, with the exception, perhaps, of one or two,
have been evacuated by the inhabitants, and more or less
destroyed by the enemy.”</p>

<p>Again Macnaghten and Elphinstone took counsel together
on that 8th of December, and again they parted to
give their opinions the shape of official correspondence.
It had now become absolutely necessary that they should
determine upon the course to be pursued, for good or for
ill. Returned to his quarters, therefore, the Envoy wrote
the following letter to the General, to bring the question
to an official issue:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pr4">8th Dec., 1841.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>With reference to the conversation I had the honour to hold
with you this morning, I have to request that you will be so good
as to state, for my information, whether or no I am right in considering
it as your opinion that any further attempt to hold out
against the enemy would merely have the effect of sacrificing both
His Majesty and ourselves, and that the only alternative left is to
negotiate for our safe retreat out of the country on the most favourable
terms possible. I understood you to say to-day that all our
cattle are starving, and that we have not more than three days’
provision, half-rations left for our men, whilst the difficulties of
procuring more appear to you to be insurmountable.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that we hear rumours of the approach of
reinforcements from Candahar, though nothing in an authentic
shape has yet reached us on this subject.</p>

<p class="pr"><span class="smcap">W. H. Macnaghten.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">To this letter General Elphinstone sent back an answer,
signed also by the three senior officers under his command&mdash;Brigadiers
Shelton and Anquetil, and Colonel Chambers,
who were that morning in council with their chief:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr4">Caubul, 8th Dec., 1841.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of this day’s date, requesting me to state, for your information,
whether or not it be my opinion that any further attempt to hold
out against the enemy would merely have the effect of sacrificing
both His Majesty and ourselves, and that the only alternative left is
to negotiate for our safe retreat out of the country on the most
favourable terms possible.</p>

<p>In reply, I beg to state that my opinion is that the present situation
of the troops here is such, from the want of provisions and the
impracticability of procuring more, that no time ought to be lost in
entering into negotiations for a safe retreat from the country.</p>

<p>As regards the troops at Candahar, and the rumours of their
approach to our assistance, I should be sorry, in the absence of all
authentic information, to risk the sacrifice of the troops here by
waiting for their arrival, when we are ignorant even of their having
commenced their march, and are reduced to three days’ supply of
provision for our Sepoys at half-rations, and almost entirely without
forage for our horses and cattle.</p>

<p>Our number of sick and wounded in hospital exceeds 600, and
our means for their transport is far from adequate, owing to the
death by starvation of so many of our camels; from the same cause
also we shall be obliged at this inclement season to leave the tents
and bedding behind with such a march before us.</p>

<p>As regards the King, I must be excused entering upon that point
of your letter, and leave its consideration to your better judgment
and knowledge; but I may be allowed to say that it little becomes
me, as commanding the British troops in Afghanistan, to regard the
necessity of negotiating in any other light than as concerns their
honour or welfare, both of which I should be answerable for by a
further stay here, after the sudden and universal rebellion which
has taken place throughout the dominions.</p>

<p>The whole of the grain and forage in our vicinity is exhausted,
and the defence of this extensive and ill-situated cantonment will
not admit of distant expeditions to obtain supplies from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
strongly-fortified dwellings of an armed and hostile population, our
present numbers being insufficient for its defence, and obliging the
whole of the troops to be almost constantly under arms.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I can only repeat my opinion that you should lose
no time in entering into negotiations.</p>

<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">W. K. Elphinstone</span>, Major-Gen.,</p>
<p class="pr">Commanding in Afghanistan.</p>

<p class="pi4 p1">I concur in the above opinions.</p>

<p class="pi4 p1">In a military point of view, I concur in the above.</p>

<p class="pi4 p1">I also concur.</p>
<p class="pr6"><span class="smcap">R. Chambers</span>, Lieut.-Col.,</p>
<p class="pr">Commanding Cavalry.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Still shrinking from the dreadful thought of surrender,
Macnaghten, soon after the receipt of this letter, went
over to the General’s quarters, and wrung from him a
reluctant promise to make one more attempt to secure
supplies, by an expedition against one of the forts or
villages in which they were known to be stored. A council
of war was held that evening at the General’s quarters.
The Envoy was present at the meeting. The commissariat
officers were also in attendance. There was a long
and stormy discussion. At length it was determined that
on the following morning a detachment of infantry and
cavalry, with a gun, should be despatched, accompanied
by Captain Johnson, to the village of Khoja Rewash,
some four miles from cantonments, where it was believed
that a considerable supply of grain was stored. The
village was to be surprised before daybreak. The inhabitants
were to be called upon to sell their grain; and, in
the event of their acquiescence, Captain Johnson was to
purchase it. But in the event of their refusal, the village
was to be carried by assault, and the grain taken by force.
The detachment was to start at two o’clock, and, that
there might be no delay in the departure of the force,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
every preparation was to be made before that hour, and
the troops were to be under arms for an immediate
march.</p>

<p>The appointed hour arrived. Captain Johnson was
ready to accompany the detachment. The troops were
under arms; but no preparations had been made for their
departure. A bridge was to have been laid down for the
passage of the cavalry and artillery, and covered with
straw, that no noise might be made to rouse the suspicions
of the enemy; but at two o’clock no orders had been
issued, and it was evident that there were doubts and
embarrassments to impede the progress of the expedition.
Something was wrong, and it became known at last that
the enterprise was discovered to be a dangerous one. The
enemy were in force in the dilapidated village of Beh-meru,
and so, just as day began to dawn, the enterprise
was altogether abandoned.</p>

<p>In the course of the day intelligence of a cheering character
was received from Jellalabad. Sale’s little garrison
had sallied out and gallantly defeated the enemy. It was
hoped by the Envoy and a few others, who were turning
their eyes in every direction, straining to catch even the
faintest ray of hope, that the improved aspect of affairs at
Jellalabad would induce the military authorities to make
new efforts to maintain their position. But all hope of
this kind was soon dissipated. The General, fearful of
the encouragement of such expectations, addressed an
official letter to the Envoy, stating that the intelligence
received from Sir R. Sale did not, in his opinion, after the
most mature consideration, so improve their situation as
to alter the sentiments expressed in his letter of the preceding
day, as to the necessity of a treaty being entered
into, if possible, with the enemy; but he looked upon the
arrival of this account of the success obtained over the
rebels as most opportune, for he considered that it could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
not but prove highly advantageous in our negotiations.
The General could only see in the cheering news from
Jellalabad another reason for entering into terms with the
enemy.</p>

<p>All this time the Envoy had been anxiously looking for
tidings of the advance of the force under Colonel Maclaren,
which had been despatched from Candahar. The
communications with that place had been so completely
cut off, that it was not until the 10th of December that
Macnaghten received intelligence from Colonel Palmer,
who commanded the garrison at Ghuznee, that there was
little prospect of Maclaren’s brigade making good its
march to Caubul. The inclemency of the weather and
the loss of baggage-cattle had been so great, that Maclaren,
struggling on with difficulty, was dreading the necessity
of a retrograde move. The Envoy had been eager to
hold out so long as the least hope remained of receiving
succour from the westward. That hope was now rapidly
waning. The provisions in cantonments were almost
wholly exhausted. On the morning of the 11th there was
just food enough for the day’s consumption of the fighting
men. The camp-followers were starving. Food was not
to be obtained by purchase, for the villagers would not
sell; food was not to be obtained by fighting, for the soldiers
would not fight. Macnaghten had urged the nobler
course, until repeated disappointments had made him
despair of military success. There was now, indeed,
nothing left to him but to negotiate with the enemy, or to
suffer the force in cantonments to perish by the slow
process of starvation before his face. He had suggested
every other course to no purpose. He had resisted the
importunities of the military authorities, clamouring for
surrender, until there were no provisions in store for the
morrow, and no hope of replenishing our empty granaries.
He could not now any longer resist; so he drew out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
rough draft of a treaty, and met the Afghan chiefs in
conference.</p>

<p>The meeting took place at the distance of about a mile
from the cantonments, on the banks of the Caubul river.
Captains Lawrence, Trevor, and Mackenzie accompanied
the Envoy, with a few troopers of the body-guard as an
escort. The chiefs of all the principal tribes in the country
were present. Among the leading men assembled
were Mahomed Akbar Khan, Oosman Khan, Sultan Mahomed
Khan, Mahomed Sheriff, Mahomed Shah Khan,
and Khoda Buksh Khan, Ghilzye. The first salutations
over, the Envoy drew forth the draft treaty he had prepared,
and read in Persian the following articles, with
their preamble, to the assembled chiefs:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">Whereas it has become apparent from recent events that the continuance
of the British army in Afghanistan for the support of Shah
Soojah-ool-Moolk is displeasing to the great majority of the Afghan
nation; and whereas the British Government had no other object in
sending troops to this country than the integrity, happiness, and
welfare of the Afghans, and, therefore, it can have no wish to remain
when that object is defeated by its presence; the following conditions
have been agreed upon between Sir W. H. Macnaghten, Bart.,
Envoy and Minister at the Court of Shah Soojah-ool-Moolk for the
British Government on the one part, and by Sirdar [] for the
Afghan nation on the other part.</p>

<p>1st. The British troops now at Caubul will repair to Peshawur
with all practical expedition, and thence return to India.</p>

<p>2nd. The Sirdars engage that the British troops shall be unmolested
in their journey, shall be treated with all honour, and
receive all possible assistance in carriage and provisions.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Here, Akbar Khan, with characteristic impetuosity,
interrupted the Envoy, saying that there was no need to
furnish our force with supplies, as there was no impediment
to their marching on the morrow. The other chiefs
rebuked him for this interference. The remainder of the
treaty was then read, as follows, without any further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
uncourteous interruptions; and, this ebullition over, the
young Barukzye himself subsided into repose.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">3rd. The troops now at Jellalabad shall receive orders to retire
to Peshawur, so soon as the envoy-and-minister is satisfied that their
progress will be uninterrupted.</p>

<p>4th. The troops now at Ghuznee will follow, <i>viâ</i> Caubul, to
Peshawur, as soon as arrangements can be made for their journey
in safety.</p>

<p>5th. The troops now at Candahar, or elsewhere within the limits
of Afghanistan, will return to India, either <i>viâ</i> Caubul or the Bolan
Pass, as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made, and the
season admits of marching.</p>

<p>6th. The stores and property of whatever description formerly
belonging to Ameer Dost Mahomed Khan will be restored.</p>

<p>7th. All property belonging to British officers which may be left
behind in Afghanistan will be carefully preserved and sent to India
as opportunities may offer.</p>

<p>8th. Shah Soojah-ool-Moolk will be allowed either to remain in
Afghanistan on a suitable provision for his maintenance, not being
under one lakh of rupees per annum, or to accompany the British
troops on their return to India.</p>

<p>9th. All attention and respect will be paid to such of the Shah’s
family as may be unable to accompany him, and they shall be permitted
to occupy their present place of residence in the Balla Hissar
until their return to India, should the Shah resolve in accompanying
the British troops.</p>

<p>10th. On the safe arrival of the British troops at Peshawur,
arrangements will be immediately made for the return to Afghanistan
of the Ameer Dost Mahomed Khan, his family, and all other
Afghans detained in India.</p>

<p>11th. So soon as the Ameer with his family shall reach Peshawur,
on their return to Caubul, the family of the Shah shall be allowed
to return towards India.</p>

<p>12th. For the due fulfilment of the above conditions four respectable
British officers will be left in Caubul as hostages, and will be
allowed to return to India on the arrival of the Ameer and his
family at Peshawur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>13th. Sirdar Mahomed Akbar Khan, Sirdar Mahomed Oosman
Khan, and such other chiefs of influence as may be so disposed, will
accompany the British troops to Peshawur.</p>

<p>14th. Notwithstanding the retirement of the British troops from
Afghanistan, there will always be friendship between that nation
and the English, so much so that the Afghans will contract no
alliance with any other foreign power without the consent of
the English, for whose assistance they will look in the hour of
need.</p>

<p>15th. Should it hereafter be the desire of the Afghan nation, and
the British Government to consent thereto, a British resident at
Caubul may be appointed to keep up the friendly communication
between the two governments, but without interfering in any way
with the internal administration of Afghanistan.</p>

<p>16th. No one is to be molested on account of any part he may
have taken in the late contest; and any person desirous of going
to India with the British troops shall be permitted to do so.</p>

<p>17th. From the date on which these articles are agreed, the
Sirdars above named undertake that the British troops shall be
supplied with provisions on rendering payment for the same.</p>

<p>18th. All British officers and troops who may be unable from
any cause, to quit Afghanistan immediately shall be treated with all
honour and respect, and receive every assistance until the state of
the season and of their preparations admits of their departure.</p></div>

<p class="p1">The conference lasted two hours. The terms of the
treaty were discussed with as much calmness and moderation
as could have been expected, and its main stipulations
were agreed to by the assembled chiefs. It was
resolved that the British troops should evacuate their
cantonments within three days, and that the chiefs
should, in the meanwhile, send in provisions for their
use. The meeting broke up, and Captain Trevor accompanied
the Khans to the city, “as a hostage for the
sincerity of the Envoy.”</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to write anything in vindication
of the conduct of Macnaghten with respect to this
early treaty. His vindication is to be found in the preceding
correspondence with the military chiefs. But a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
few pregnant sentences, in which he has himself recorded
the circumstances under which he was at last induced
to throw himself upon the forbearance of the enemy,
ought to be laid before the reader, embodying as they
do the Envoy’s own justification of his conduct. “The
whole country,” he wrote in his unfinished report, “as
far as we could learn, had risen in rebellion; our communications
on all sides were cut off; almost every public
officer, whether paid by ourselves or his Majesty, had
declared for the new governor, and by far the greater
number even of his Majesty’s domestic servants had
deserted him. We had been fighting forty days against
very superior numbers, under most disadvantageous circumstances,
with a deplorable loss of valuable lives, and
in a day or two we must have perished from hunger, to
say nothing of the advanced season of the year and the
extreme cold, from the effects of which our native troops
were suffering severely. I had been repeatedly apprised
by the military authorities that nothing could be done
with our troops; and I regret to add that desertions to
the enemy were becoming of frequent occurrence among
our troops. The terms I secured were the best obtainable,
and the destruction of fifteen thousand human beings
would little have benefited our country, whilst the government
would have been almost compelled to avenge our
fate at whatever cost. We shall part with the Afghans
as friends, and I feel satisfied that any government which
may be established hereafter will always be disposed to
cultivate a good understanding with us. A retreat without
terms would have been impracticable. It is true, that
by entering into terms, we are prevented from undertaking
the conquest of the entire country&mdash;a measure which, from
my knowledge of the views of government, I feel convinced
would never be resorted to even were the means at
hand. But such a project, in the present state of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Indian finances, and the requisitions for troops in various
quarters, I knew could not be entertained.”<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>I wish that it were not more difficult to acquit the
military chiefs. General Elphinstone’s correspondence
contains what he conceived to be a justification of his
conduct in urging Macnaghten to capitulate. Brigadier
Shelton has left upon record a statement of which it is
only just to his memory that it should have the full
credit: “The great extent of cantonments,” he wrote in
the narrative drawn up by him at Buddeeabad, “and
defenceless nature of the ramparts (an officer having
actually ridden over them), effectually compromised our
force, by the necessity to watch and protect every foot of
the works, from their extreme weakness, and the consequent
danger of sending out a force of sufficient strength
to ensure victory, against a numerous enemy flushed with
success, while our troops were disheartened, on half-rations
of parched wheat, and harassed and worn out from constant
duty on the ramparts, whose weakness required
their presence night and day, exposed to excessive cold by
night, with little covering and less comfort. The great
oversight of neglecting to bring in provisions for the winter
could not be remedied. The impossibility of procuring
them by force in a country studded with forts, every one
of which required a regular attack, was apparent to all.
The Ricka-bashee Fort, close to cantonments, cost us
200 men. What must distant ones not have cost us&mdash;sniped
the whole way out and home by long rifles out of
range of our fire, through snow, with the thermometer at
zero? There was nothing under such circumstances dishonourable
in a necessary retreat, which might have been
effected before the snow fell, and whilst there were a few
days’ provisions in store, with some hope of success. Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
provisions been stored in cantonments for the winter, the
troops would have been in better heart, and resistance
made until timely assistance should arrive. The party at
Jellalabad was more favoured, both in provisions and a
more congenial climate.”</p>

<p>Posterity will not accept such apologies as these. That
difficulties and dangers of no common kind beset the path
of the military commanders in those Caubul cantonments
is not to be gainsaid. But war is made of difficulties and
dangers. It is the glory of the soldier to live in the midst
of them, and to do his best to overcome them. Elphinstone
and Shelton were sent to Caubul to face difficulties
and dangers, not to turn away from them. The existence
of the evils here set forth in such formidable array is not
questioned or doubted. Some at least of them were the
growth of our own weakness; for difficulties not met with
energy and decision are wonderfully reproductive. They
thicken around the wavering and irresolute. If, on the
10th of December, Elphinstone and Shelton, after bravely
struggling, throughout six long peril-laden weeks, against
the difficulties which were thronging around them, had at
last succumbed to their pressure, they would have been
entitled to the respect, no less than to the pity, of the
world. But it was not so much that the circumstances
were strong, as that the men were weak. As early as the
5th of November&mdash;three days after the first outbreak of
the insurrection&mdash;Elphinstone had begun to think and to
write about terms. Shelton was not much behind him in
his recommendations of the same ignoble course. They
were both of them brave men. In any other situation,
though the physical infirmities of the one, and the cankered
vanity, the dogmatical perverseness of the other, might
have in some measure detracted from their efficiency as
military commanders, I believe that they would have
exhibited sufficient constancy and courage to rescue our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
army from utter destruction, and the British name from
indelible reproach. But in the Caubul cantonments they
were miserably out of place. They seem to have been
sent there, by superhuman intervention, to work out the
utter ruin and prostration of an unholy policy by ordinary
human means.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, indeed, that the chief conduct of our
military operations, in this critical conjuncture, should
have been in the hands of two men so utterly unlike each
other, and yet so equal in their incapacity for such command.
I believe it be no exaggeration to affirm, that
there were not in India two men of the same high rank
equally unfitted by circumstance and by character for the
command of the Caubul army. The one had everything
to learn; the other had everything to unlearn. Elphinstone
knew nothing of the native army. Shelton was
violently prejudiced against it. Elphinstone, in a new
and untried position, had no opinion of his own, but flung
himself upon the judgment of any one with confidence
enough to form and express one. Shelton, on the other
hand, was proud of his experience, and obstinately wedded
to his own opinions. Opposition irritated and enfeebled
him. To overrule and to thwart him at the commencement
of an enterprise entrusted to his charge was to
secure its ignominious failure. Whether by accident or
by design, he generally contrived to demonstrate the
soundness of his own judgment, by being disastrously
beaten in every attempt to carry out the projects forced
upon him by the preponderating counsels of others. Had
Shelton exercised the chief military control, though he
might have committed some errors, he would probably
have distinguished himself more than in the secondary
position which he was compelled to occupy. On him was
thrown the burden of the executive duties. Whilst others
overruled his opinions, he was made responsible for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
success of enterprises against which he protested, and with
which he was the last man in the country heartily to
identify himself under circumstances so irritating and
depressing. It would have been impossible, indeed, to
have brought together two men so individually disqualified
for their positions&mdash;so inefficient in themselves, and so
doubly inefficient in combination. Each made the other
worse. The only point on which they agreed was, unhappily,
the one on which it would have been well if they
had differed. They agreed in urging the Envoy to
capitulate. There was a curse upon them that clouded
their brains and made faint their hearts, and moved them
to seek safety in a course at once the most discreditable
and the most perilous of all that opened out before them.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">[December, 1841.]</p>

<p class="pch">Preparations for the Retreat&mdash;Evacuation of the Balla Hissar&mdash;Progress
of the Negotiations&mdash;Continued Delay&mdash;Variations of the
Treaty&mdash;Designs of the Envoy&mdash;Overtures of Mahomed Akbar
Khan&mdash;Death of Sir William Macnaghten&mdash;His Character.</p>

<p><span class="beg">And</span> now began preparations for the retreat. Orders
were dispatched to the Balla Hissar for the evacuation of
that position by the British troops; and it was said that
in two days the whole force would be moving towards
the British provinces. Doubtful of our good faith, the
chiefs withheld the promised supplies; but small quantities
of grain were procured from the Balla Hissar. In the
meanwhile, though our commissariat store-rooms were
empty, our military magazines were full.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> There was a
scramble among the soldiers for new arms and accoutrements;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
and even the camp-followers, to whom ammunition
was served out by orders of the General, came in for
a share of the spoil.</p>

<p>The Balla Hissar was evacuated by the British troops
on the 13th of December. Akbar Khan had pledged
himself to conduct the party safely to cantonments.
Grain was of unspeakable value at this time; but time
was valuable too. In our efforts to save the former we
lost the latter. There were 1600 maunds of wheat to be
conveyed to cantonments, and the packing and loading
were more than a day’s work. Great as had been the
exertions of the commissariat officer, and worthy of all
praise, Major Ewart was compelled to break in upon his
labours, and move off his force, before the baggage-cattle
were ready to start with their precious loads. It was six
o’clock in mid-winter, very dark, and bitterly cold, when the
troops began to march slowly out of the Balla Hissar.
Akbar Khan and his followers had been for some time in
readiness to escort them to cantonments; and now it was
whispered among the King’s people that a trap had been
laid for the destruction of the force, and that not a man
would reach his destination. Major Ewart moved out his
men; and the party had scarcely cleared the gate when a
rush, it was said, was made by some of Akbar Khan’s jezailchees
to obtain admittance to the Balla Hissar. The gates
were immediately closed; the King’s troops on the walls
opened a smart fire of musketry on friends and on foes
alike. Then followed a shower of grape, striking down
some of our Sepoys, and creating no little dismay and confusion
in our ranks.</p>

<p>The Seeah-Sungh hills, along the base of which lay the
road between the Balla Hissar and the cantonments, were
bristling with Ghilzye banditti. At that late hour, Akbar
Khan declared that it would be almost impossible to
restrain them, and that therefore, if the British force would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
secure its safety, it must abstain from prosecuting its
march towards cantonments until he had made arrangements
with the chiefs&mdash;in fact, that it must halt till the
morrow. On that dark, frosty December night this was,
indeed, a discouraging announcement. The troops were
halted on low marshy ground, under the walls of the fort.
The ground was white with the hoar frost. The air was
bitingly cold. They would have lit fires and clustered
around them, but there was no fuel in their reach. They
had no tents. They had no bedding. They had no food.
They were every minute expecting to be attacked by the
enemy. In this cheerless, miserable state they could do
nothing but stand, or walk about, looking for the rising of
the morning star.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The night was a long one, but it came
to a close at last. The miseries of the darkness were now
to be succeeded by the perils of the dawn. They were
only about six hundred strong, and the road was infested
by thousands of the enemy. They had nothing on which
to depend but the good faith of Akbar Khan and their own
steadiness and courage. Happily the former did not fail
them. Akbar Khan did not play the traitor. The rear-guard
was molested by a party of Afghans, and the Sirdar
himself, with a few followers, galloped into the midst of his
hostile countrymen, and threatened to cut down all who
dared to oppose the progress of the detachment. About
ten o’clock the force reached cantonments in safety; but
“thoroughly exhausted with hunger and fatigue.”<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>It has been stated, that when on the evening of the
13th of December the British troops moved out of the
Balla Hissar, an attempt was made by some of the followers
of Akbar Khan to obtain admittance. It has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
said that it was the Sirdar’s object to seize the gate, so as
to admit the main body of his followers, and to carry the
place by storm. It has been surmised, also, that the
Sirdar delayed the march of Major Ewart’s detachment,
hoping that the gates of the Balla Hissar would be reopened
to the British troops; and that then, under cover
of the night, his followers might force an entrance into
the place.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> A very different account of this incident,
however, has been left on record by the Envoy himself.
“On the 13th, of December,” he wrote, “it was agreed
upon that our troops should evacuate the Balla Hissar,
and return to the cantonment, whilst the Barukzyes should
have a conference with his Majesty, with a view to his
retaining the nominal powers of sovereignty, they, for
their own security, placing a guard of their own in the
upper citadel. No sooner, however, had our troops left
the Balla Hissar, than his Majesty, owing to some panic
or misunderstanding, ordered the gate to be shut, and the
proposed conference was thereby prevented. So offended
were the Barukzyes, that they determined never to offer
his Majesty the same terms again. In explanation of his
conduct, his Majesty states that the party whom the
Barukzyes desired to introduce was not the party which
had been agreed upon.”<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> This was, probably, one of the
last sentences ever penned by Sir William Macnaghten.
It closes the fragment of the official report found in his
writing-desk after his death.</p>

<p>The treaty read by the Envoy at the conference on the
11th of December contained an article involving the
formal abdication of Shah Soojah. The restoration of the
Barukzye Sirdars to their old principalities was, at that
time, decreed by both contracting parties; but the meeting
had scarcely broken up, when some of the Douranee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
chiefs, jealous of the power of the Barukzyes, which had
ever been put forth to the injury and depression of the
tribes, recoiled from this perilous stipulation, and began
to think of the retention of the King, at all events as a
puppet and a name.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> On the following day it was proposed
by the chiefs that Shah Soojah should remain on
the throne, on condition of his intermarrying his daughters
with the leading Afghan Sirdars, and vesting the
Wuzeership in the family of the Barukzyes. It was stipulated
also that the King, whose love of pomp and ceremony
was one of his besetting infirmities, and who had excited
the indignation of many of the chiefs by his haughty
bearing towards them, should dispense with some of the
regal formalities which had given them so great offence.
The proposal, sanctioned by the British minister, was formally
made to the Shah. There was the loss of his kingdom
on the one side; there was the loss of some regal
dignity on the other. The King hesitated; then yielded
a reluctant assent; and a few days afterwards withdrew it
altogether. His pride and his fear both deterred him
from forming such an alliance with the chiefs. He was
unwilling so to sully the purity of the royal blood; and he
could not trust to the good faith of the Sirdars after the
departure of his British allies. And so the treaty with
the Barukzye chiefs reverted to its original shape, and
the Shah determined to return to the British provinces,
from which he had never yet emerged without plunging
into new disasters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>The stipulations of the treaty were now to be brought
into effect. But mutual distrust existed between the
parties, and each was unwilling to give the other any
advantage by being the first to act up to the obligations
that it imposed. The British authorities called upon the
chiefs to send in the provisions which they had undertaken
to supply; and the chiefs called upon the British
authorities to demonstrate the sincerity of their promises
to retire from Afghanistan, by giving up the different forts
which they occupied in the neighbourhood of cantonments,
and by placing hostages in their hands. The question of
the abandonment of the forts was officially discussed
between the Envoy and the General, and the result was
an order for their cession.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>No time was lost in carrying this arrangement into
effect. Whatever dilatoriness may have been displayed
on other occasions, there was no want of alacrity evinced
when anything was to be yielded to the enemy. Our
garrisons were speedily withdrawn from the forts, and
the victorious insurgents duly placed in possession of
them. By four o’clock in the afternoon, the Afghan
conquerors were sitting on the walls of these ceded forts,
looking into the British cantonments, and joking over
our discomfiture.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> A brother of the Newab Zemaun
Khan was sent in as a hostage on the part of the
enemy;<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> and a small supply of attah was furnished to the
troops.</p>

<p>Provisions, however, came in very slowly; and carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
was not sent in at all. There was a mixed crowd of
robbers and fanatics swarming between the city and the
cantonments, ever on the alert to intercept the supplies
that were sent in either by the Sirdars or by private
speculators. All kinds of outrages were committed,
in the very face of our guards, and under the very
muzzles of our guns; but not a shot was fired upon
the plunderers. Our enemies, now become “our new
allies,” were to be treated with all possible consideration.
Nothing was to be done to interrupt the good feeling
which was now said to have been established; and so,
whilst our troops were starving, the military authorities
suffered the grain so eagerly looked for by the wretched
force to be swept away from them, under the very walls
of cantonments, by a miserable rabble, whom a few rounds
of grape would have scattered like a flock of sheep.</p>

<p>This was a season of perilous procrastination. Both
parties seemed anxious to postpone the day that was to
witness the departure of the British force; and each was
suspicious of the good faith of the other. The chiefs
withheld, from day to day, the provisions and the carriage-cattle,
with which they had undertaken to facilitate our
escape from Afghanistan; and Macnaghten, hoping still
against hope, and sanguine, even in the midst of every
kind of discouragement, still thought that “something
might turn up” to avert the humiliation of an enforced
withdrawal from the country which we had entered with
so much pomp and parade. It was still possible, he
thought, that Maclaren’s brigade might make good its
way to Caubul. It was not then known that it had
retraced its steps to Candahar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Then snow began to fall. On the 18th of December,
the doomed force looked out upon the new horror. From
morning to evening prayer it fell with frightful perseverance,
and before sunset was lying many inches thick
upon the ground. Our difficulties had now fearfully increased.
Had the force been set in motion a few days
before the first snow fall, and, moving lightly, pushed on
by forced marches through the passes, it might have
reached Jellalabad in safety. But now everything was
against us. The elements were conspiring for our destruction.
It was more and more painfully obvious, every
day, that the curse of God was brooding over the agents
of an unrighteous policy. Whatever may have been the
causes of that week’s delay&mdash;whether the bad faith of
the chiefs, the irresolution of the Shah, or the reluctance
of the British Envoy, it cut away from under us the
last hope that remained of rescuing the British force
from the annihilating dangers that hemmed it in on
every side.</p>

<p>The 22nd was now fixed upon as the day for the
departure of the British troops. On the 19th, the Envoy
and the General despatched letters to Ghuznee, Candahar,
and Jellalabad, ordering the evacuation of those
positions. Money was given freely to the chiefs for cattle
which was not sent in for our use; and it was believed
that Mahomed Akbar was expending the treasure thus
raised on the instruments of our destruction. “Our new
allies” had become more insolent and defiant. As our
difficulties thickened, their demands rose. All hope of
succours from Candahar vanished on that 19th of December,
when intelligence of the return of Maclaren’s
brigade was received by the Envoy. Macnaghten had
clung to this chance, with desperate tenacity, to the last&mdash;and
now he abandoned all hope of saving the reputation
of his country by beating the enemy in the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>But he had not yet abandoned all hope of saving the
reputation of his country by playing a game of dexterous
diplomacy, such as could only have been played against
a number of disunited factions, almost as hostile to each
other as to the common foe. It is not easy to group into
one lucid and intelligible whole all the many shifting
schemes and devices which distracted the last days of the
Envoy’s career. It is probable that at this time he could
have given no very clear account of the game which he
was playing. He appears to have turned first to one
party and then to another, eagerly grasping at every new
combination that seemed to promise more hopeful results
than the last. His mind was by this time unhinged;&mdash;his
intellect was clouded; his moral perceptions were
deadened. The wonder is, not that he was pressed down
at last by the tremendous burden of anxiety which had
sate upon him throughout those seven long weeks of
unparalleled suffering and disaster, but that he had borne
up so long and so bravely under the weight.</p>

<p>It seems, indeed, that Macnaghten, at this time, never
knew, from one day to another, with whom he would
eventually conclude a treaty for the extrication of the
unhappy force from the perils that girt it around as with
a ring of fire. He was throwing about money in all
directions, and there were hungry claimants, pressing on
now from one direction now from another, eager to turn
the sufferings of the Feringhees to the best account, and
to find the best market for their own influence and
authority. He saw no honesty and sincerity among the
chiefs; he saw that they were all contending one against
the other; every man thinking only of himself. He
knew that they had failed in their engagements to him,
and he doubted whether he was bound by the obligations
which he had contracted, or was free to negotiate
with any one who was willing, and able, to offer or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
accept terms less degrading in themselves and less likely
to be violated. It was his general design to keep the
different factions in a state of antagonism with each
other, and to cling to the one best able to protect us
from the malice of the rest. But he could not determine,
of the many combinations that could be formed, which
was the best calculated to evolve a state of things most
favourable to British interests, and so he seems to have
had more than one game in hand at the same time, and
hardly to have known which was to be played out.</p>

<p>Ostensibly Macnaghten was at this time in treaty with
the Barukzye party. But he was offering at the same
time large sums of money to the Ghilzyes and to the
Kuzzilbashes to side with the Shah and the British; and
if they had declared themselves openly on our side, he
might have thrown over the Barukzye alliance. “You
can tell the Ghilzyes and Khan Shereen,” he wrote on
the 20th of December to Mohun Lal, “that after they
have declared for his Majesty and us, and sent in 100
<i>kurwars</i> of grain to cantonments, I shall be glad to give
them a bond for five lakhs of rupees; and if Naib Sheriff
is satisfied that they will do so, he should advance to them
as much money as he can. I fear for Mahomed Shah
that he is with Akbar; but you will know best. You
must let me know before sunrise, if possible, what is
likely to be the effect of this proposal, as I must talk
accordingly to the Barukzyes, who have shown no disposition
to be honest. To save time, you may tell Khan
Shereen to correspond with the Shah, if there is a chance
of success.”</p>

<p>On the following day he wrote again to Mohun Lal,
unfolding his views more distinctly with regard to the
contemplated alliance with the Ghilzyes and the Kuzzilbashes,
out of which he still hoped that something might
be evolved to avert the retreat which was so loathsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
to him. “In conversing,” he wrote, “with anybody, you
must say distinctly that I am ready to stand by my
engagement with the Barukzyes and other chiefs associated
with them; but that if any portion of the Afghans
wish our troops to remain in the country, I shall think
myself at liberty to break the engagement which I have
made to go away, which engagement was made believing
it to be in accordance with the wishes of the Afghan
nation. If the Ghilzyes and Kuzzilbashes wish us to stay,
let them declare so openly in the course of to-morrow,
and we will side with them. The best proof of their wish
for us to stay is to send us a large quantity of grain this
night&mdash;100 or 200 kurwars. If they do this, and make
their salaam to the Shah early to-morrow, giving his
Majesty to understand that we are along with them, I
will write to the Barukzyes and tell them my agreement
is at an end; but if they (Ghilzyes and Kuzzilbashes) are
not prepared to go all lengths with us, nothing should be
said about the matter, because the agreement I have
made is very good for us.”</p>

<p>An hour afterwards he wrote again to Mohun Lal,
repeating all this in still more decided language, and
declaring that if grain were obtained he should think
himself “at liberty to break his agreement of going away
on Friday, because that agreement was made under the
belief that all the Afghan people wished us to go away.”
“Do not let me appear in this matter,” he wrote, in conclusion;
“say that I am ready to stand by my engagement,
but that I leave it to the people themselves.”
And again after the lapse of another hour, he wrote:
“If any grain is coming in to-night, let me have notice
of it a few minutes before. Anything that may be
intended in our favour must appear before noon to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Far better than any explanations that I could offer do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
such words as these unfold the character of Macnaghten’s
designs. The days on which they were written saw the
Envoy in conference, near the banks of the canal, with
Akbar Khan and a few chiefs of the Barukzye party. As
time advanced, the Sirdars rose in their demands; and
every new meeting witnessed the dictation of fresh terms.
They called upon us to deliver up to them all our military
stores and ammunition, and to surrender the married
families as hostages for the fulfilment, on our part, of the
conditions of the treaty. Then they demanded that
Brigadier Shelton should be given over to them as a
hostage; but the Brigadier was unwilling to accept the
duty, and the proposal was declined. The hostages given
up on the 21st of December were Lieutenants J. B.
Conolly, the Envoy’s relative and assistant, and Lieutenant
Airey, of the 3rd Buffs, who had been acting as the
General’s aide-de-camp.</p>

<p>On the following day the commissary of ordnance,
Lieutenant Eyre, was “ordered to conduct an officer of
the Newab Zemaun Khan over the magazine, that he
might make choice of such stores as would be most
acceptable to the chiefs.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> At the same time the Envoy
sent his carriage and horses as a present to Akbar Khan.
He was now beginning to despair of deriving any real
assistance from the Ghilzyes, who were slow to declare
themselves openly on our side, and he saw plainly how
dangerous it was to appear to be in treaty with them
and the Barukzyes at the same time. Some doubts, too,
of the honesty of the course he was pursuing began to
obtrude themselves upon him; and he wrote accordingly
to Mohun Lal, requesting him to instruct the Ghilzyes
not to send in any grain until further advised upon the
subject. “The sending grain to us just now,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
“would do more harm than good to our cause; and it
would lead the Barukzyes to suppose that I am intriguing
with a view of breaking my agreement; but I can never
break that agreement so long as all the Khawanen wish
me to stand by it. Pray thank our friends, nevertheless,
for their kind attention to our interest. I wish very much
to please them, and am sorry my treasury is so empty.”</p>

<p>On the same day Macnaghten sent 7000 rupees to
Khan Shereen Khan, the chief of the Kuzzilbashes, but
urged Mohun Lal to keep it secret, as there was scarcely
any money left. He had become doubtful by this time
of the honesty of intriguing with one party, whilst he
was bound by engagements to another; so he urged the
Moonshee to tell the Ghilzyes to send him no more grain.
“If,” he wrote on the 22nd of December, “while our present
agreement lasts I were to receive a large supply of grain
from the Ghilzyes, suspicion would be raised that I intend
to break my engagement, and wish to keep the troops
here, in spite of the wishes of all the chiefs to the contrary.
It would be very agreeable to stop here for a few
months instead of having to travel through the snow;
but we must not consider what is agreeable, but what is
consistent with our faith.”</p>

<p>It was on the evening of this 22nd of December, when
Macnaghten, long tossed about on a sea of doubt and
distraction&mdash;perplexed in the extreme by the manifest
bad faith and the ever-increasing demands of the chiefs&mdash;seeing
no end to the perilous uncertainties of his position,
and wearied out beyond human endurance by days and
nights of ceaseless anxiety and bewilderment&mdash;was in a
temper to grasp at any new thing that might seem to
open a door of escape from the embarrassments which
surrounded him, that Akbar Khan sent in Captain Skinner
from the city with a new string of proposals.</p>

<p>The Envoy had been warned of the danger of treating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
independently with the young Barukzye Sirdar; he had
been told that treachery was spreading itself around him,
and that he would be enclosed in its toils. But he had
now become desperate. Anything was better than the
wearing uncertainty which had so long been unhinging
his mind. Akbar Khan sent tempting proposals; and
the Envoy flung himself upon the snare. He knew that
there was danger, but he had become regardless of
it. Anything was better than the life he had so long
been leading. Even death itself was better than such a
life.</p>

<p>Captain Skinner came into cantonments, accompanied
by Mahomed Sadig and Surwar Khan, the Lohanee merchant.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
The English officer sate down to dinner with
the Envoy whilst the two Afghans remained in another
room. A gleam of hope passed over Macnaghten’s careworn
face when Skinner told him, in a light jesting
manner, that he was the bearer of a message from Akbar
Khan of a portentous nature, and that he felt as one
loaded with combustibles.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> But the message was not
then delivered. The proposals were to be stated by
the Afghan delegates, who were soon closeted with the
Envoy. Skinner alone was present at the interview.
Mahomed Sadig stated the proposals that had been made
by Akbar Khan. It was proposed that an agreement
should be entered into on the following day, to the effect
that Akbar Khan and the Ghilzyes should unite themselves
with the British troops, which were to be drawn
up outside of cantonments, and at a given signal should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
assault Mahmood Khan’s fort and seize the person of
Ameen-oollah Khan. Then followed a startling offer, from
which the Envoy shrunk back with abhorrence. This
was the offer of Ameen-oollah’s head, which, for a sum of
money, Mahomed Sadig declared should be presented to
the British Envoy. Macnaghten at once rejected the offer.
It was never, he said, his custom, nor that of his country,
to pay a price for blood. Then Mahomed Sadig went on
to state the proposals of the Barukzye Sirdar. The
English were to remain in Afghanistan until the spring;
and then, to save their credit, by withdrawing, as though
of their own free will. Shah Soojah was to remain in the
country as King, and Akbar Khan was to be his Wuzeer.
As a reward for these services, Akbar Khan was to receive
an annuity of four lakhs of rupees from the British
Government, and a bonus of thirty lakhs!</p>

<p>Wild as were these proposals, the Envoy caught eagerly
at them. He did not hesitate for a moment. He had,
from first to last, clung to the hope of something being
evolved out of the chaos of difficulty, that would enable
him to retain his position in the country, at all events till
the coming spring; and now there suddenly welled up
within him a hope that he had obtained the object of his
desires. He now accepted the proposals; and signified
his assent in a Persian paper written by his own hand.
With this the Afghan delegates returned to the city and
made known to Akbar Khan the success of their mission.
Captain Skinner returned with them.</p>

<p>The morning of the 23rd of December found Macnaghten
restless and excited. A great crisis had arrived. That
day was to decide the fate of the British force, and
determine the question of the loss or the salvation of our
national honour. It is probable that the morning brought
with it some doubts and misgivings; but he brushed the
obtrusive thoughts aside, and endeavoured to persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
himself, as he did to persuade others, that there was no
treachery to be feared.</p>

<p>Having breakfasted, he sent for the officers of his staff&mdash;Lawrence,
Trevor, and Mackenzie&mdash;who were his friends
and counsellors, to whom on all occasions but this he had
entrusted his designs&mdash;to accompany him to the conference
with Akbar Khan. Mackenzie, finding him alone, heard
from him now, for the first time, the history of this new
negotiation, and at once exclaimed that it was a plot.
“A plot!” replied the Envoy, hastily; “let me alone for
that&mdash;trust me for that!”</p>

<p>He had braced himself up with desperate courage for
the conference which was to be followed by such great
results; and now he sent for the General to acquaint him
with the nature of the proposals and to request his aid to
carry the scheme into effect. Startled by the announcement,
and little comprehending all the depths and intricacies
of the perilous game which the Envoy had now in
hand, Elphinstone asked what part the other Barukzyes,
who had been foremost in the previous negotiations, were
to take in those now on foot, and was told in reply that
they were “not in the <i>plot</i>.” On the untutored ear of
the single-minded veteran this significant monosyllable
smote with an ominous sound. He began now to understand
the double game which was being played by the
Envoy on one side, and the young Barukzye Sirdar on the
other, and he eagerly asked the former if he did not
apprehend that some treachery was at work. “None at
all,” said Macnaghten, in reply; “I wish you to have two
regiments and two guns got ready, as speedily and as
quietly as possible, for the capture of Mahmood Khan’s
fort; the rest you may leave to me.” But still the
General spoke of the danger of such machinations, and
urged him to pause before he committed himself irretrievably
to so perilous a course. Elphinstone had unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
been talking about danger so incessantly since
the very commencement of the outbreak, that now, when
he uttered only words of common sense and prudence,
the warning notes fell upon Macnaghten’s ears like the
old imbecile croakings of timidity and irresolution which
had been irritating him for so many weeks, and he now
turned away with impatience, saying, “I understand these
things better than you.”<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Elphinstone went; but in
spite of Macnaghten’s confidence, he could not dispossess
himself of the belief that treachery was brewing, and that
the Envoy was rushing upon destruction. So, hoping
that yet something might be done to arrest him, he sate
down and wrote him a letter, pointing out the danger of
dividing the force; dwelling upon the probable treachery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
of the Afghans, of whom he said the cantonments were
full; and asking what guarantee there was for the truth
of all that had been said. It was the last letter ever
addressed to the Envoy. It never reached its destination.</p>

<p>About the hour of noon the little party&mdash;Macnaghten,
Lawrence, Trevor, Mackenzie, and a few horsemen&mdash;set
out on their ill-omened expedition. Shelton had been
invited to accompany them; but he was occupied in
getting ready the two regiments and the guns, and was,
therefore, unable to attend the conference.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The troops,
however, were not ready when the ambassadorial cavalcade
rode out of the Seeah-Sungh gate, and the Envoy, observing
the backwardness of the military chiefs, bitterly
remarked that it was of a piece with all their arrangements
since the commencement of the outbreak. He
then went on to speak of the enterprise on which they
were engaged; admitted that it was a dangerous one;
said that he was playing for a heavy stake, but the prize
was worth the risk that was to be incurred. “At all
events,” he said, “let the loss be what it may, a thousand
deaths were preferable to the life I have of late been
leading.”</p>

<p>They passed out of cantonments. As they went, Macnaghten
remembered that a beautiful Arab horse, which
Akbar Khan had much coveted, and which the Envoy
had purchased from its owner,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> had been left behind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Mackenzie was sent back for it, that it might now be
presented to the Sirdar. Lawrence was told to hold himself
in readiness to ride to the Balla Hissar, to communicate
with the King. There were many suspicious appearances
which excited the apprehensions of all but the Envoy.
Crowds of armed Afghans were hovering about the cantonment,
and clustering in the neighbourhood of Mahmood
Khan’s fort. Macnaghten saw nothing but the prospect
of escaping the disgrace of a sudden retreat from
Afghanistan. He looked neither to the right nor to the
left. He had a great object in view, and he kept his eyes
steadily upon it. He did not even, when the chiefs met
him, perceive that a brother of Ameen-oollah Khan was
one of the party.</p>

<p>Near the banks of the river, midway between Mahmood
Khan’s fort and the bridge, about 600 yards from the
cantonment, there were some small hillocks, on the further
slope of which, where the snow was lying less thickly than
on other parts, some horse-cloths were now spread by one
of Akbar Khan’s servants. The English officers and the
Afghan Sirdars had exchanged salutations and conversed
for a little while on horseback. The Arab horse, with
which Mackenzie had returned, had been presented to
Akbar Khan, who received it with many expressions of
thanks, and spoke also with gratitude of the gift of the
pistols which he had received on the preceding day.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
was now proposed that they should dismount. The whole
party accordingly repaired to the hill-side. Macnaghten
threw himself, in a reclining position, on the bank; Trevor
and Mackenzie, burdened with presentiments of evil, seated
themselves beside him. Lawrence stood behind his chief
until urged by one of the Khans to seat himself, when he
knelt down on one knee, in the attitude of a man ready
for immediate action. A question from Akbar Khan, who
sate beside Macnaghten, opened the business of the conference.
He abruptly asked the Envoy if he were ready
to carry out the proposals of the preceding evening?
“Why not?” asked Macnaghten. The Afghans were by
this time gathering around in numbers, which excited
both the surprise and the suspicion of Lawrence and
Mackenzie, who said, that if the conference was to be a
secret one, the intruders ought to be removed. With a
movement of doubtful sincerity some of the chiefs then
lashed out with their whips at the closing circle; but
Akbar Khan said that their presence was of no consequence,
as they were all in the secret with him.</p>

<p>Scarcely were the words uttered, when the Envoy and
his companions were violently seized from behind. The
movement was sudden and surprising. There was a scene
of terrible confusion, which no one can distinctly describe.
The officers of the Envoy’s staff were dragged away, and
compelled each to mount a horse ridden by an Afghan
chief. Soon were they running the gauntlet through a
crowd of Ghazees, who struck out at them as they passed.
Trevor unfortunately slipped from his insecure seat behind
Dost Mahomed Khan, and was cut to pieces on the spot,
Lawrence and Mackenzie, more fortunate, reached Mahmood
Khan’s fort alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the Envoy himself was struggling
desperately on the ground with Akbar Khan. The look
of wondering horror that sat upon his upturned face will
not be forgotten by those who saw it to their dying day.
The only words he was heard to utter were, “<i>Az barae
Khoda</i>” (”For God’s sake”). They were, perhaps, the
last words spoken by one of the bravest gentlemen that
ever fell a sacrifice to his erring faith in others. He had
struggled from the first manfully against his doom, and
now these last manful struggles cost the poor chief his
life. Exasperated past all control by the resistance of
his victim, whom he designed only to seize, Akbar Khan
drew a pistol from his girdle&mdash;one of those pistols for the
gift of which only a little while before he had profusely
thanked the Envoy&mdash;and shot Macnaghten through the
body. Whether the wretched man died on the spot&mdash;or
whether he was slain by the infuriated Ghazees, who now
pressed eagerly forward, is not very clearly known&mdash;but
these miserable fanatics flung themselves upon the prostrate
body of the English gentleman, and hacked it to
pieces with their knives.</p>

<p>Thus perished William Hay Macnaghten; struck down
by the hand of the favourite son of Dost Mahomed.
Thus perished as brave a gentleman as ever, in the midst
of fiery trial, struggled manfully to rescue from disgrace
the reputation of a great country. Throughout those
seven weeks of unparalleled difficulty and danger he had
confronted with stedfast courage every new peril and perplexity
that had risen up before him; and a man of peace
himself, had resisted the timid counsels of the warriors,
and striven to infuse, by the manliness of his example,
some strength into their fainting hearts. Whatever may
be the judgment of posterity on other phases of his character,
and other incidents of his career, the historian
will ever dwell with pride upon the unfailing courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
and constancy of the man who, with everything to discourage
and depress him, surrounded by all enervating
influences, was ever eager to counsel the nobler and the
manlier course, ever ready to bear the burdens of responsibility,
and face the assaults of danger. There was but
one civilian at Caubul; and he was the truest soldier in
the camp.</p>

<p>It is not easy to estimate correctly the character of
William Macnaghten. Of the moral and intellectual attributes
of the ill-fated Envoy very conflicting accounts
have been rendered; and it is probable that in all these
conflicting accounts some leaven of truth resides. There
are few men whose characters are not made up of antagonistic
qualities, and Macnaghten was not one of the
few. In early life he had distinguished himself by the
extent of his philological acquirements; and was reputed
as one of the most accomplished Oriental scholars in the
presidencies of India. With a deep insight into the character
of the natives of the East was blended the kindliest
sympathy and toleration towards them. In the knowledge,
indeed, of the native languages, the institutions,
and the character of the people of Hindostan, he was surpassed
by none of the many accomplished officers who
have made them their study. His long connexion with
the judicial department of the public service had afforded
him opportunities, which his temper and his taste led him
to improve, of maturing and perfecting this essential
branch of official knowledge. In attention to business
he was one of the most unwearying of men: his pen was
ever in his hand; he wrote rapidly, and expressed himself
on most subjects with clearness; he was quick in his
apprehension of the views of others, and accommodated
himself with facility to shifting circumstances. But at
this point there are many who believe that they cease to
tread upon undebateable ground. It is admitted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
he was an accomplished Oriental scholar, a good judicial
officer, an apt secretary, and a kind-hearted man; but it
is denied that, in any enlarged acceptation of the word, he
is entitled to be called a statesman.</p>

<p>Sir Alexander Burnes was constantly writing to his
friends in India, “Macnaghten is an excellent man, but
quite out of place <i>here</i>.” Burnes was not an unprejudiced
witness; and he, doubtless, expressed himself in language
too sweeping and unqualified. But there are many who
believe with Burnes, that Macnaghten was out of his place
in Afghanistan. It is hard to say who would not have
been more or less out of place, in the situation which he
was called upon suddenly to occupy. The place, indeed,
was one to which no English officer ought to have been
called. For a Calcutta Secretary to be at Caubul at all
was necessarily to be out of place. If Macnaghten, suddenly
transplanted from the bureau of an Anglo-Indian
Governor to the stirrup of an Afghan monarch, is chargeable
with some errors, it is, perhaps, more just, as it is
more generous, to wonder not that those errors were so
numerous, but that they were so few. To govern such a
people as the Afghans through such a King as Shah
Soojah, was an experiment in which an English officer
might fail without the sacrifice of his reputation. When
we come to think, now, of what was attempted, we cease
to marvel at the result. The marvel is, that utter ruin
did not overtake the scheme at an earlier date&mdash;that the
day of reckoning was so long delayed. The policy itself
was so inherently faulty that success was an unattainable
result.</p>

<p>The causes of the failure are not to be sought in the
personal character of the Envoy. That character may
have been one of many accidental circumstances which
may in some sort have helped to develop it; but, sooner
or later, ruin must have overtaken the scheme, let who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
might be the agent of it. In this view of the case Macnaghten
is not to be acquitted; but it is on Macnaghten
the Secretary, not on Macnaghten the Envoy, that our
censures must then descend. Macnaghten the Envoy,
however, was not free from human infirmity. Most men
have an unhappy faculty of believing what they wish to
be true. In Macnaghten this propensity was unnaturally
developed. God had cursed him with a strong delusion
that he should believe a lie. He believed in the popularity
of Shah Soojah and the tranquillity of Afghanistan.
To have admitted the non-existence of either, would
have been to have admitted the failure of the policy
which he had recommended, and with which he was, in no
small measure, personally identified. But Macnaghten
did not seek to deceive others: he was himself deceived.
When he spoke of the popularity of Shah Soojah, he
believed that the Shah was popular; when he reported
the tranquillity of Afghanistan, he believed that the
country was tranquil. He was sincere, but he was
miserably mistaken. Everything he saw took colour in his
eyes from the hues of his own sanguine temperament. From
the day when on entering Candahar he beheld a joyous
people welcoming their restored monarch with feelings
almost amounting to adoration, to the last luckless day
of his life, when he went out to the fatal conference,
firmly believing in the good faith and good feeling of
his Afghan allies, he continued steadily to create for
himself all kinds of favourable omens and encouraging
symptoms, and lived in a state of blind confidence unparalleled
in the history of human infatuation. To this
self-deception some of the finest qualities of his nature
largely contributed. The very goodness of his heart and
generosity of his disposition moved him to regard the
character and conduct of others with a favour to which
they were seldom entitled. Macnaghten was too nobleminded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
to be suspicious&mdash;but he erred on the other
side; he wanted some of the sterner stuff which will not
suffer the soundness of the judgment to be weakened by
the generosity of the heart.</p>

<p>When not blinded by his partiality for any pet projects
of his own, he was by no means wanting in political
sagacity. He could decide justly, as he could promptly,
on points of detail as they rose up one by one before him;
but as soon as anything occurred to cast discredit upon
the general policy of the Afghan expedition, by indicating
the germs of failure, he resolutely refused to see what
others saw, and censured those others for seeing it.
Hence it was that he received coldly, if not contemptuously,
those elaborate general reviews of the condition and
prospects of Afghanistan which Burnes and Conolly thrust
upon him, and resented every effort that was made by
Rawlinson and others to draw his attention towards the
unquiet and feverish symptoms which, from time to time,
developed themselves in different parts of the unsettled
country. His correspondence indicates an unwillingness,
rather than an inability, to take any large and comprehensive
views of Afghan policy. He seems to have
shrunk from applying to that policy the test of any great
principles; and to have addressed himself rather to the
palliation of accidental symptoms than to the eradication
of those constitutional diseases which were eating into
the very life of the government which he directed.</p>

<p>Of Macnaghten’s humanity I have never entertained a
doubt. But it is a proof of the inconsistency even of the
kindest and most amiable characters, that the Envoy,
when greatly disquieted and perplexed by the difficulties
which thickened around him, and irritated by the opposition,
which he could not subdue, sometimes thought
of resorting to measures repugnant to humanity, for the
suppression of evils which baffled all the more lenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
efforts of legitimate diplomacy. But these sterner feelings
soon passed away; and all the more generous sentiments
of his nature held dominion over him again. He regretted
the excesses&mdash;always rather those of word than of deed&mdash;into
which he had been momentarily betrayed, and was
as merciful towards a fallen enemy as he had been eager
in his pursuit of a triumphant one. Macnaghten was
anything but a cautious man; his first hasty impulses
were often set down in writing with perilous unreserve;
and it would be unjust to record against him, as his
positive opinion, everything that he set down suggestively
in his hasty letters to his numerous correspondents, or
spoke out still more hastily to his friends.</p>

<p>Posterity may yet discuss the question, whether, in
these last fatal negotiations with Akbar Khan, Macnaghten
acted strictly in accordance with that good faith
which is the rule of English statesmen, and for which
our country, in spite of some dubious instances, is still
honoured by all the nations of the East. In one of the
last letters ever written by him, the Envoy said, “It
would be very agreeable to stop here for a few months
instead of to travel through the snow; but we must not
consider what is agreeable, but what is consistent with
our faith.” On the same day, too&mdash;the day before his
death&mdash;he had written, “I can never break that agreement
(with the Barukzyes) so long as all the Khawanen
wish me to stand by it.” It has been questioned whether
the negotiations he was then carrying on with the Ghilzyes
and Kuzzilbashes were consistent with his obligations to
the Barukzye Sirdars. The stipulations, however, on the
part of the British diplomatist, in this case, extended no
further than the promise of certain money payments
in return for certain specific services, and Macnaghten
may have considered himself justified in retaining those
services conditionally on the rupture of the existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
covenant with the Barukzye chiefs. That covenant, indeed,
was one of so precarious a nature&mdash;it was sliding away
from him more and more certainly as time advanced&mdash;there
was so little prospect of its obligations being fulfilled,
that it seemed necessary to have something to fall
back upon in the event of the open annulment of the
treaty, the obligations of which had long been practically
denied. Up to the evening of the 22nd of December,
Macnaghten had been willing to abide by the stipulations
of the treaty with the confederate chiefs; but there were
such manifest symptoms of bad faith on the part of the
chiefs constantly breaking out, that it appeared to him
but ordinary prudence to prepare himself for an event
so probable as an open rupture. He was ready to proceed,
in mutual good faith, to the accomplishment of the
original treaty; and so long as the chiefs adhered to their
engagements, he was prepared to evacuate the country,
but he believed that it was his duty to prepare himself
also for a rupture with the chiefs, and to purchase supplies,
wherever he could obtain them, for the use of the
troops in the event of their retaining their position.</p>

<p>But the compact with Akbar Khan was altogether of
another kind. There was nothing of a conditional character
about it. The Envoy had, in the course of the day,
virtually acknowledged that to break off the negotiations
then pending with the chiefs would be a breach of good
faith. Nothing had occurred between the hour in which
he wrote this to Mohun Lal and that in which he received
the overtures of Akbar Khan, to absolve him from obligations
from which he was not absolved before. The
same principle of diplomatic integrity which he had applied
to the case of the Ghilzye alliance was doubly applicable
to this: “It would be very agreeable to stop here for a few
months instead of to travel through the snow; but we
must not consider what is agreeable, but what is consistent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
with our faith.” If we read Macnaghten’s subsequent
conduct by the light of these high-principled
words, it must in truth be pronounced that he stands
self-condemned.</p>

<p>In estimating the character of these transactions, it
should always be borne steadily in mind that the Afghan
chiefs had from the first violated their engagements with
the British, and exacted from them after-conditions not
named in the treaty. Their want of faith, indeed, was
so palpable, that Macnaghten would, at any time, have
been justified in declaring that the treaty was annulled.
It is plain, that whilst they were violating their engagements
he was under no obligation to adhere to the conditions
of the violated treaty. But it appears to me that
this matter is altogether distinct from the question of the
honesty of negotiating with one party whilst negotiations
are pending with another. There would have been no
breach of faith in breaking off the treaty with the confederate
chiefs; but it was a breach of faith to enter into
any new engagements until that treaty was broken off. It
is certain that up to the time of his receipt of the fatal
overtures from Akbar Khan, Macnaghten considered that
he was bound by his engagements with the confederate
chiefs. He might, it is true, have declared those engagements
at an end, but until such a declaration was made,
he was not at liberty to enter secretly into any new negotiations
practically annulling the old.</p>

<p>And whatever objections may lie against the general
honesty of the compact, it is certain that they apply with
double force to that portion of it which involved the
seizure of Ameen-oollah Khan. It is not to be justified
by any reference to the infamous character of that chief.
Ameen-oollah Khan was one of our “new allies.” He
had been, with the other chiefs, in friendly negotiation
with Macnaghten. It was now proposed, during a suspension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
of hostilities&mdash;whilst, indeed, we were in friendly
intercourse with the Afghan chiefs, this very Ameen-oollah
Khan included&mdash;that a body of troops should be got ready
as quietly as possible for secret service, that a sudden
attack should be made on the unsuspecting garrison of
Mahmood Khan’s fort, and that one of our allies&mdash;one of
the chiefs with whom the Envoy was in treaty&mdash;should
be violently seized. I confess that I cannot see anything
to justify such a measure as this. It certainly was not
in accordance with that good faith, the observance of
which Macnaghten had declared to be of more importance
than the retention of our position in the country.</p>

<p>But although I cannot bring myself to justify the act,
either on the plea that the chiefs had not observed the
engagements into which they had entered, or that Ameen-oollah
Khan was an infamous wretch, and one of the archenemies
of the British, it appears to me to be as little the
duty of the historian severely to condemn the actor as to
justify the act.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> It is one of those cases in which the
exercise of charity is a solemn duty&mdash;one of those cases,
to the consideration of which every one should bring the
kindliest resolution to weigh well the temptation before
he measures the offence. There are cases to which, it is
my deliberate conviction, a strict application of the ordinary
rules of right and wrong would be a grievous injustice.
It is easy, in one’s closet, to sit in judgment upon the
conduct of a man tempted far beyond the common limits
of human temptation&mdash;environed and hemmed in by
difficulties and dangers&mdash;overwhelmed with responsibility
which there is no one to share&mdash;the lives of sixteen
thousand men resting on his decision&mdash;the honour of his
country at stake&mdash;with a perfidious enemy before him, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
decrepit general at his side, and a paralysed army at his
back&mdash;driven to negotiate by the imbecility of his companions,
and then thwarted in his negotiations by the
perfidy of his “new allies.” But if, without injustice and
cruelty, we would pass sentence on the conduct of a man
so environed, we must ponder well all these environments,
and consider what must have been the effect of seven
wearing weeks of such unparalleled trial even on the
strongest mind, and what must have been the temptation
that arrayed itself before him, when there suddenly
gleamed upon him a hope of saving at once the lives of
his companions and the credit of the British nation. If,
when that great temptation burst suddenly upon his path,
and, dazzled by its delusive brilliancy, he saw the great
object set before him, but did not see the slough of moral
turpitude to be passed through before it could be attained,
it is right that we should remember that Macnaghten,
though a good and a brave man, was <i>but</i> a man after all,
and that human strength, at the best, is but weakness to
resist the pressure of overwhelming circumstance.</p>

<p>We have not the same intelligible guides to a right
estimate of the conduct of Akbar Khan. If we regard
the assassination of the British Envoy as a deliberate,
predetermined act, it can only be said of it that it stands
recorded as one of the basest, foulest murders that ever
stained the page of history. But it does not appear
that the murder of Macnaghten was premeditated by the
Sirdar. It seems to have been the result of one of those
sudden gusts of passion which were among the distinguishing
features of the young Barukzye’s character, and
which had often before betrayed him into excesses laden
with the pangs of after-repentance. The seizure of the
Envoy and his companions, which was designed by the
Sirdar, was an act of deliberate treachery, which the
chiefs would perhaps endeavour to justify by declaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
that they only designed to do towards the Envoy as the
Envoy had declared himself willing to do towards Ameen-oollah
Khan.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> But whilst Macnaghten had only consented
to a proposal made to him by others&mdash;whilst he
had merely yielded to temptation, and at the instance of
one Afghan chief consented to the betrayal of another&mdash;Akbar
Khan, with deliberate subtlety and malice, wove
the net which he was to cast over the deluded Englishman,
and treacherously enclosed him in the toils. The trap
was cunningly laid and craftily baited; and the unhappy
Envoy, all his perceptions blunted by the long-continued
overstraining of his mind, fell readily into the snare, and
went insanely to his undoing. Like Burnes, he had
been warned of the treachery that encompassed him;
and like his ill-fated colleague he had disregarded the
warnings that might have saved him. The brave confidence
of Macnaghten clung to him to the last; his
sanguine temperament, at one time so dangerous and
disastrous, at another so noble and inspiriting&mdash;which
more than anything else had sustained the character of
the nation throughout the sore trials which it had brought
upon us&mdash;lured him at last to his death.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">[December, 1841-January, 1842.]</p>

<p class="pch">The Capitulation&mdash;Supineness of the Garrison&mdash;Negotiations resumed&mdash;Efforts
of Major Pottinger&mdash;Demands of the Chiefs&mdash;The Final
Treaty&mdash;Humiliation of the Garrison&mdash;General Remarks.</p>

<p><span class="beg">It</span> is recorded, that on the 23rd of December, 1841, the
representative of the British Government was slain at a
conference with the Afghan Sirdars, within sight of the
British cantonments at Caubul; and it is now to be
added to the record that this&mdash;the foulest indignity that
one nation can put upon another, the murder of an
ambassador in the performance of his ambassadorial
duties&mdash;roused not the dormant energies of the military
chiefs, or awakened them to a sense of the depths of
humiliation in which they were plunging their unhappy
country. The British Envoy was killed, in broad day,
and upon the open plain, but not a gun was fired from
the ramparts of the cantonment; not a company of troops
sallied out to rescue or to avenge. The body of the
British Minister was left to be hacked to pieces, and his
mangled remains were paraded, in barbarous triumph,
about the streets and bazaars of the city.</p>

<p>The military chiefs assert that they did not know,
until the day after his death, that Macnaghten had been
murdered. Elphinstone says it was thought by himself
and others that the Envoy had proceeded to the city for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
the purpose of negotiating.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> But there were those in
cantonments who had seen the tumult at the place of
conference, and who knew that some violence had been
committed. One officer said that he distinctly saw the
Envoy fall; and that afterwards he could see the Ghazees
hacking to pieces the body of the murdered man. If the
General did not tremble for the safety of the political
chief, he was the only man in the garrison who encouraged
the belief that the lives of the Envoy and his
companions, if they had not been already sacrificed, were
not now in imminent danger. There was something
very remarkable, if not suspicious, in the unwonted confidence
of the General at this time. It was not his habit
to look upon the bright side of things, or to take any
great pains to encourage and reassure the troops under
his command. He had, on almost every occasion, taken
the most desponding view of affairs, and freely expressed
his apprehension of dangers, which had no existence save
in his own mind. But now he sent round his Adjutant-General
to the troops to assure them of the Envoy’s
safety. They were all under arms. Captain Grant rode
to the head of each regiment, and by Elphinstone’s orders
told them that the conference had been interrupted by
the Ghazees&mdash;that the Envoy and his companions had
been removed to the city&mdash;but that they would return
immediately to cantonments. Some who heard this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
authoritative announcement still believed that they would
never hear the Envoy’s voice, or look upon his living face
again. The whole garrison was in a state of painful excitement;
and when the shades of evening fell over the
cantonment, and still no certain intelligence of the fate of
Macnaghten had arrived, not an officer joined the mess-table
of his regiment, or sate down to his solitary meal,
without a leaden weight of gloom and despondency at his
heart.</p>

<p>The day, indeed, had been one of intense anxiety. It
had been, too, a busy stirring time within the cantonment
walls. The authorities seem to have been stimulated
into something of activity at home, though they could not
bring themselves to do anything abroad. They got up a
little war against the Afghans, whom business or curiosity
had brought into cantonments, and who were now either
eagerly trafficking or idly looking about them in the
square. They had been doing the same, and more, for
many weeks&mdash;at a time, too, when danger resulted from
their spying the nakedness of the land. But now that
this danger had passed, the military authorities began for
the first time to think of expelling the Afghans from cantonments.
All the men of rank who could be found were
placed under arrest; whilst hundreds of less note, apprehending
that a similar fate might be awaiting them,
rushed towards the different gates, jostling and upsetting
each other on the icy ground, and creating a scene of indescribable
confusion in their efforts to escape. A lull
succeeded; but as the evening advanced, the noise and
confusion in the city were such that the troops were
again turned out and the cantonment-works manned, in
expectation of coming dangers. The Ghazees were
mustering, in the belief that the British troops would
attack the city and avenge the murder of their ambassador.
But all thought of doing had long ago passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
away from the minds of our military chiefs. They had
settled down into the belief that now it had become their
duty only to suffer.</p>

<p>With the morrow came a confirmation of the worst
fears of those who never thought to see the Envoy reenter
the cantonment-gates. They waited for tidings of
him, and tidings came at last. Though he had been killed
almost within musket-shot of our ramparts, nothing had
been done by the military chiefs to solve the painful
doubts which perplexed them throughout that disastrous
23rd of December. It was thought that if they only
waited long enough for it, some certain intelligence would
come at last; and it came at last, on the afternoon of the
24th, in the shape of a letter from Captain Lawrence, and
certain overtures from the confederate chiefs, seeking a
renewal of the negotiations on the basis of the treaty
initiated by the deceased Envoy.</p>

<p>As the game of negotiation was now to be commenced
anew, it was necessary to secure the services of a new
negotiator. There was a man then in cantonments of
whom little had been seen or heard for some weeks, and
of whom the chroniclers and journalists of the insurrection
had up to this time made little or no mention, in connexion
with the stirring scenes in which Macnaghten had
been the chief actor, but to whom the garrison now turned
as to the only man fitted to take the Envoy’s place.
Ever since his arrival from Charekur, Major Pottinger
had been incapacitated from active employment by the
wound he had received in the early part of November.
The severity of his sufferings had necessarily been much
increased by the hardships of his perilous journey from
Charekur to Caubul, and during the greater part of the
time since his arrival at the latter place he had been
confined to his bed. But he was now, in the difficult
conjuncture that had arisen, ready to bring all the manly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
vigour and high courage which had done so much to roll
back from the gates of Herat the tide of Persian invasion,
to the new duty of endeavouring to rescue his country
from the degradation in which it had been sunk by the
faint hearts of the military chiefs.</p>

<p>The evening of the 24th saw Pottinger in council with
General Elphinstone, Brigadiers Shelton and Anquetil,
and Colonel Chambers, the four senior officers of the
garrison. The chiefs had sent in a letter, sealed by
Mahomed Zemaun Khan, Akbar Khan, Ameen-oollah
Khan, Oosman Khan, and others, with a memorandum
of the terms on which they were prepared to grant the
army a safe conduct to Peshawur. This was now translated
to the military officers, who were eager to conclude
the engagement into which Macnaghten had consented to
enter for the withdrawal of all the British troops from
Afghanistan. Caubul, Candahar, Ghuznee, and Jellalabad
were all to be immediately evacuated. Dost Mahomed
was to be released from captivity, and restored, with all
other Afghan prisoners, to his own country, while Shah
Soojah was to remain, or to depart, as he might please;
and in the event of his electing the former course, to
receive an annual pension of a lakh of rupees. A certain
number of English gentlemen were to be left behind as
hostages for the evacuation of the country by the British
troops, whilst certain Afghan chiefs were to accompany
our retiring garrisons to guarantee their safe conduct to
the frontier. Such were the main features of the treaty
which Pottinger found in course of negotiation when the
desperate game of diplomacy was placed in his hands. It
need not be added that large sums of money were
to be paid to the chiefs, as the price of the immunity
which they pledged themselves to guarantee to our
discomfited army on their retreat through the dreadful
passes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>To Pottinger even these terms appeared deeply humiliating,
and, had the military authorities consented to aid
him, he would have rejected them with scorn and defiance.
But he stood before the leaders of our army alone and
unsupported. It was urged that further resistance was
useless, and that Macnaghten had already pledged his
country to the acceptance of the proposed terms. So the
draft-treaty was sent back, with some notes of assent
appended to the several articles. It would have been
strange if the chiefs had not then risen in their demands&mdash;if
they had not dictated to our unhappy people new
terms more grievous than those which had already been
accepted. Four additional articles were sent back with
the original draft. The first stipulated that all the coin
in the public treasury should be given up to the chiefs;
the second, that the British should abandon all their guns
but six; the third, that all the spare muskets should be
left behind; and the fourth, that “General Sale, together
with his wife and daughter, and the other gentlemen of
rank who are married and have children,” should be left
as hostages at Caubul, until the arrival of Dost Mahomed
and the other Afghan prisoners from Hindostan.</p>

<p>And thus sinking more and more deeply in the great
slough of humiliation, the unhappy leaders of the Caubul
force groaned through the festal Christmas season. No
thought of the dear homes of England inspired them to
uphold England’s dearest honour. On the 26th of December,
encouraging letters were received from Macgregor
at Jellalabad, and from Mackeson at Peshawur, setting
forth that reinforcements were on their way up from
India, and urging the authorities at Caubul to hold out
to the last. Addressed to Macnaghten, these letters were
opened by one who had carried to Macnaghten’s duties
all Macnaghten’s constancy and courage. He saw in these
tidings fit opportunity to urge again upon the military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
leaders the duty of continued resistance. Moreover, there
were intestine feuds in the city; the enemy were weakened
by disunion; Shah Soojah seemed to be gathering strength;
and Oosman Khan, Barukzye, who really desired the salvation
of the British force, had offered to conduct it safely
to Peshawur for five lakhs of rupees. These facts were
communicated to Elphinstone, who summoned a council
of war. The two Brigadiers, Shelton and Anquetil, Colonel
Chambers, and Captains Grant and Bellew, met the military
and the political chief at the house of the former.
Earnestly, and almost hopefully, Pottinger set forth these
encouraging circumstances, and besought the military
chiefs not to treat with the enemy. The reasons with
which he enforced his request, were as weighty as the
spirit which informed them was noble. He contended
that they had no right to bind their government to
future measures which might be injurious to the public
welfare; that they had no right to order other commanding
officers to abandon the trusts confided to them; no
right to sacrifice large sums of public money to purchase
their own safety. He contended, too, that the enemy
were not to be trusted; that, in all human probability,
they would betray us; and that it would be safer, therefore,
as it would be more honourable, to make a great
effort to occupy the Balla Hissar till the spring, or else
to fight their way to Jellalabad, and there await the
promised reinforcements.</p>

<p>Eldred Pottinger had not the gift of speech&mdash;had not a
commanding presence; but there was natural eloquence
in these plain soldierly words, and the resolute bearing
of the man imparted dignity to his utterance of them.
Almost was the General, though greatly enfeebled at this
time by disease, roused into action by them. But Shelton
vehemently contended that neither course suggested by
Pottinger was practicable, and that it was better to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
any sum of money than to sacrifice the force. In this
opinion the council of war, true to the character of such
assemblies, unanimously concurred. So grievously disappointed
and mortified as he was, Pottinger renewed his
diplomatic intercourse with the enemy, and proceeded to
give effect to the terms of the hated treaty.</p>

<p>Captain Lawrence, who since his seizure at the fatal
conference, had resided in the house of Akbar Khan in
the city, was sent for to draw the bills, and on the 27th
of December came into cantonments. Fourteen lakhs of
rupees were then signed away. Then came a more dreadful
concession. The enemy demanded the immediate surrender
of our guns. All but six field-pieces, which were
to be suffered to accompany the retreating force, were now
to be given up to the triumphant Afghans. This was the
sorest trial that the British garrison had yet been called
upon to encounter. It burnt in our humiliation as with
a brand of iron. The troops chafed under this crowning
indignity; and the military chiefs, when the hour of surrender
came, shrunk from the mortifying necessity of
giving up to a barbarous foe those muniments of war,
which soldiers of all nations honour, and some almost
idolise. But they could not bring themselves to risk a
renewal of the conflict by openly refusing to accede to the
demand. So, Pottinger hoping, perhaps, that something
might yet arise to break off the negotiations, determined
to procrastinate. He began by giving up the Shah’s guns,
two by two, on successive days; but if this alleviated
the pain of the concession, it did not really soften the
disgrace.</p>

<p>From day to day, guns, waggons, small arms, and
ammunition were surrendered to the enemy. The
hostages, too, were given up. Lieutenants Conolly and
Airey were already in the hands of the Afghans. Now
Captains Walsh and Drummond, and Lieutenant Warburton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
and Webb, were sent to join them in captivity.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
The enemy were anxious to get some of the married
families into their hands; but there was a general unwillingness
on the part of the officers to suffer their wives
and children to be cast upon the forbearance of an enemy
supposed to be so cruel, so treacherous, and so unscrupulous.
On the 29th, such of the sick and wounded as
were believed to be unable to bear the fatigues of the
march, were sent into the city; and two medical officers,
Drs. Berwick and Campbell, were appointed to take charge
of them.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January, 1842, the ratified treaty was
sent in, bearing the seals of eighteen of the Afghan Sirdars.
It contained all the stipulations already detailed, except
that relating to the surrender, as hostages, of the English
ladies. Even without this crowning indignity it was
miserably degrading. There is nothing, indeed, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
painful in all this painful history than the progress of the
negotiations which resulted in the accomplishment of this
treaty. The tone of the enemy throughout was arrogant,
dictatorial, and insulting; whilst the language of our
diplomatists was that of submission and self-abasement.
It is so rare a thing for Englishmen to throw themselves
upon the clemency and forbearance of an insolent foe,
that when we see our officers imploring the Afghan chiefs
“not to overpower the weak with suffering,”<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> we contemplate
the sad picture of our humiliation with as much
astonishment as shame. The disgrace rests on the military
commanders. Pottinger, had he not been overruled
in council, would have snapped asunder the treaty before
the faces of the chiefs, and appealed again to the God of
Battles.</p>

<p>There were other things, too, to humble us. The state
of affairs in cantonments was something very grievous to
contemplate. The Ghazees hovering round the walls were
insulting our people at their very gates, and bearding
them at the very muzzles of their guns. Intercepting the
supplies of grain which the commissariat had purchased
with so much difficulty, they drove off the cattle and ill-treated
their attendants. The chiefs declared that they
had no power to prevent these outrages, and told the
British authorities that they should order the garrison to
fire upon all who molested them. Officers and men alike
were burning to chastise the wretches who thus insulted
their misfortunes; but they were not suffered to fire a
shot. The Afghans had triumphed over us so long with
impunity that they now believed the Feringhees had sunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
into hopeless cowardice, and had become as patient of
injury and insult as a herd of broken-spirited slaves.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>All this was very hard to bear. Other trials, too, were
upon them. All who had friends in the city&mdash;and many
of our officers had among the Caubulees faithful and long-tried
friends&mdash;were now receiving from them alarming
intimations of the dangers that threatened them on the
retreat. It was no secret, indeed, either in the city or in
cantonments, that the promises of the chiefs were not to
be depended on, and that treachery was brewing for the
destruction of our wretched force. Mohun Lal warned
Pottinger that the chiefs were not to be believed, and
that unless their sons accompanied the army as hostages,
it would be attacked upon the road. To this Pottinger
replied: “The chiefs have signed the treaty, and their
sons accompany us. As for attacking us on the road, we
are in the hands of God, and him we trust.”<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Again,
Mohun Lal wrote that the troops would be attacked as
soon as they quitted cantonments; but it was too late
now to recede. Other warning notes of still more ominous
import were sounded at this time. Moollah Ahmed Khan
told Captain Johnson, that Akbar Khan had sworn that
he would obtain possession of the English ladies as a
pledge for the safe return of his own wives and family;
and annihilate every soldier of the British army, with the
exception of one man, who should reach Jellalabad to tell
the story of the massacre of all his comrades.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>But to those who pondered well the dangers that
threatened the retreating force in the gloomy defiles between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Caubul and Jellalabad, there was something more
terrible still than the vindictive treachery of the Afghan
tribes. Ever since the 18th of December, snow had been
falling heavily at intervals&mdash;sometimes from morning to
evening, with terrible perseverance. It was now lying
more than ankle-deep upon the ground. Already had
the Sepoys and the camp-followers begun to faint under
the cruel sufferings of a frosty winter, fearfully aggravated
by the exhaustion of all the firewood in their reach. The
trees in cantonments had already been cut down and
consumed. What was once a flourishing grove or orchard
(for they were mainly fruit-trees) had now become a desert.
But the sufferings which these wretched men, transplanted
from the torrid plains of Hindostan, were now enduring
in the Caubul cantonment, seemed but faintly to foreshadow
the misery of a long march through the dreadful
snow. Even to the hardy people of the North such a
march, it was known, must be a sore trial; but to the
weak and effeminate strangers from the plains of Hindostan,
who had followed our fortunes into those dreary
regions, it seemed to threaten nothing short of absolute
extermination.</p>

<p>Those few first days of January were days of painful
doubt and anxiety. Every preparation for the march had
been made by the garrison. For some time our officers
had been gathering together and securing such property
as they could take with them, and destroying what they
were compelled to abandon. Every night, since the commencement
of the new year, they had retired to rest,
believing that the army would commence its march on
the following morning; but the movement was delayed
day after day, because the chiefs had not completed their
promised arrangements for the safe conduct of the force.
At last, on the evening of the 5th of January, the engineer-officer
received instructions actually to commence the work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
which he had been so long in readiness to accomplish.
He was ordered to cut an opening through the rampart-walls
of the cantonment to allow the egress of the troops,
more rapidly and less confusedly, than they could pass
out through the gates. The chiefs had not sent the
promised safeguard; but, contrary to the advice of Major
Pottinger,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> the military authorities determined to march
out of their entrenchments. And so, on the following
morning, the British force, beaten and disgraced, commenced
its ill-fated retreat towards the provinces of
Hindostan.</p>

<p>I have commented upon the various incidents of the
Caubul insurrection as they have arisen, one by one, to
claim the attention of the reader; and little now remains
to be said in explanation of the causes which conduced to
the calamitous and disgraceful defeat of a British army
by an undisciplined and disunited enemy, who had no
artillery to bring into the field. Whatever more remote
causes of this lamentable failure may be found elsewhere,
it is impossible to conceal or to disguise the one galling
fact, that the British army at Caubul was disastrously
beaten because it was commanded by an incapable chief.
Whether that chief would have beaten the enemy, if the
military arrangements for which he was not responsible
had been better ordered&mdash;if the site of the cantonments
had been more judiciously chosen, and its defences more
effectively constructed, if all our magazines and godowns
had been well located and well protected,&mdash;may still be
an open question; but it appears to me that there is no
question as to whether a commanding officer of the right
stamp would have triumphed over these difficulties, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
beaten the enemy in spite of them. The Caubul cantonments
were very badly situated, and very ill-constructed
for purposes of defence; but if our troops had been commanded
by an officer with a robust frame, strong nerves,
a clear understanding, and a proper knowledge of his
business, as the chief of a mixed army of British and
Hindostanee troops, they would have crushed the insurrection
in a few hours, and demonstrated the irresistible
power of British valour and British discipline.</p>

<p>It has been said that the British army was not beaten
out of Caubul, but that it was <i>starved</i> out of Caubul.
This is a belief that I would willingly encourage, if I
could only bring my judgment to embrace it. But the
fact is, that the army was driven out of Caubul for want
of supplies, only because the troops would not fight, or
were not suffered to fight, to obtain them. The Commissariat
officers would have fed the troops, if the military
authorities had not shamefully sacrificed their supplies,&mdash;if
they had not ignominiously lost what was already in
store; and ignominiously refused to make an effort to
obtain fresh supplies from the surrounding country. The
troops, indeed, fought neither to keep their food when
they had it, nor to procure food when they had none.
There was an alacrity only in losing. The imbecility
which sacrificed the Bengal Commissariat Fort, on the
5th of November, and the miserable abandonment of the
expedition to Khoja Rewash, on the 9th of December, are
equally apt illustrations of the truth, that, if the army
was starved out of Caubul, it was only because it courted
starvation.</p>

<p>This is a very humiliating confession, but it is impossible,
without a sacrifice of truth for the sake of administering
to our national vanity, to avoid the mortifying
conclusion that the Caubul army wanted food, only because
it wanted vigour and energy to obtain it. If General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Elphinstone had thrown half as much heart into his work
as Captain Johnson threw into his, the army would not
have been starved out of Caubul. There is nothing sadder
than the spectacle of a fine army sacrificed by the imbecility
of an incapable general, and nothing more painful
than to write of it. But such humiliating revelations
are not without their uses. They operate in the way of
warning. Never again, after this frightful illustration
of the evils of a vicious system of routine, will the lives
of sixteen thousand men, and the honour of a great nation,
be placed in the hands of a senile commander, crippled
by disease and enfeebled by suffering. It was General
Elphinstone’s misfortune that he was sent to Caubul. It
was Lord Auckland’s fault that he sent him there.
General Elphinstone knew that he was incapable of performing
worthily the duties of such a command, and he
took the earliest opportunity of applying for relief from a
burden of responsibility which he was not able to bear.
Lord Auckland knew that he was incapable, for the attention
of the Governor-General was strongly called to the
fact; but he sent the infirm old General to Caubul, in
spite of the representations that were made to him by
men less jealous of the integrity of the roster than of the
honour of their country. The British army was beaten
at Caubul, because it was commanded by General Elphinstone;
and it was commanded by General Elphinstone,
because Lord Auckland decreed that it should be so.</p>

<p>General Elphinstone has left upon record a declaration
of his belief that if he had been more worthily supported
he would not have been beaten at Caubul. So long as he
held the chief command in his own hands, he&mdash;and he
alone&mdash;was responsible for all the operations of the army.
He never relinquished the command. Though he did not
take the field in person, every order emanated from him.
To him the Envoy addressed himself; with him the Envoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
took counsel. It is possible that if the second-in-command
had been an officer of a different stamp, the army would
not have been so disastrously and ignominiously beaten;
but this admission does not affect the question of responsibility.
Brigadier Shelton, throughout the siege,
held a subordinate situation. He was immediately under
Elphinstone’s orders; and though he may be chargeable
with certain individual miscarriages&mdash;with certain errors
in the executive management of details&mdash;he is not chargeable
with the great comprehensive failure which has
plunged his country into such a sea of disgrace. Of
Shelton’s faults I have not been unmindful; but when I
have admitted all his perverseness, his arrogance, his
contumacy, and expressed my belief that there was not
another man in the British army so unfitted by nature
for the post he occupied under such a General, the admission
amounts to little more than this: that Brigadier
Shelton was not the man to supply the deficiencies of
General Elphinstone. It is only because General Elphinstone
was so incapable himself that we come to canvass at
all the merits of his second-in-command. History does
not trouble itself much about seconds-in-command, when
the chiefs are fit for their posts.</p>

<p>Unquestionably Elphinstone was not well supported.
Macnaghten, in emphatic language, described the troops
as “a pack of despicable cowards.” On more than one
occasion they forgot that they were British troops, and
turned their backs upon the enemy. They did not fight,
as they would have fought if they had been well commanded.
But the commander had less reason to complain
of his troops than the troops had to complain of their
commander. It was the faint-heartedness of the commander,
at the outset of the insurrection, that dispirited
and unnerved the troops. If Elphinstone, on the 2nd of
November, had struck a vigorous blow at the then incipient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
rebellion, and proved himself, by his energy and
resolution, worthy of the confidence of the troops, they
would have had confidence in him and in themselves.
But they were held in restraint by the backwardness of
their leader; the forward feeling that then inspired them
was crushed and deadened. There was nothing to encourage
and to animate them, but everything to dishearten
and depress. They saw that the enemy were suffered to
triumph over and insult them&mdash;that the worst indignities
were unresented, the vilest outrages unpunished. Thus
abased they soon lost their self-respect, and forgot what
was due to their colours and their country.</p>

<p>Brigadier Shelton has attributed to physical causes
the deterioration of the troops; but it is rather to moral
than to physical causes that that deterioration is to be
ascribed. The troops would have borne up against continued
harassing duty in cantonments&mdash;against cold,
hunger, and fatigue; they would have kept up a brave
heart under the sorest physical trials, if there had been
no moral influences to sicken and to chill. They bore,
indeed, their outward sufferings without complaining.
Cold, hunger, and fatigue they could endure without a
murmur; but the supineness of those who suffered them
to be robbed and insulted under the very shadow of
their guns filled them with burning indignation, which,
in time, was succeeded by a reaction of sullen despondency.
They felt that they were sacrificed to the imbecility
of their commander; and, in time, under the sure
process of moral deterioration, they became in all respects
worthy of their chief.</p>

<p>Examples of individual heroism were not wanting.
Wherever Englishmen congregate, there are surely to be
found brave hearts and resolute spirits amongst them.
There were many in that Caubul garrison who bore
themselves throughout the perilous season of their beleaguerment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
in a manner worthy of the chivalry of the
empire. When the retreating force commenced its miserable
march towards the British provinces, it left behind
it the remains of many brave men who had fallen nobly
on the field of battle; and many brave men were now
bracing themselves up in the desperate resolution to sell
their lives dearly to the enemy, if treachery were at
work for their destruction. But they who had been
most eager to counsel a vigorous course of action, and
who had felt most deeply the humiliation into which
the feebleness of their chief had sunk them, were mostly
officers of the lower grades; and though the opinions of
captains and subalterns were sought, and offered when
not sought, in a manner unprecedented in the annals of
British warfare (but still short of what might have been
justified by the magnitude of the crisis), they had no
power to direct the current of events or to avert the evils
which they clearly foresaw. Even Pottinger, with all the
influence of recognised official position, and the prestige
of an heroic character, could only lift up his voice in
remonstrance against the sacrifice of national honour
involved in the humiliating treaty with the Afghan
Sirdars. The military chiefs were fixed in their determination
to abandon Afghanistan, and to leave Shah
Soojah to his fate.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">[November, 1841-January, 1842.]</p>

<p class="pch">Sale’s Brigade&mdash;Evacuation of Gundamuck&mdash;Skirmishes with the
Enemy&mdash;Occupation of Jellalabad&mdash;State of the Defences&mdash;Successful
Sallies&mdash;The Fortifications repaired&mdash;Disastrous Tidings
from Caubul&mdash;Summons to surrender&mdash;Arrival of Dr. Brydon.</p>

<p><span class="beg">Whilst</span> Elphinstone was flinging himself into the snares
of the enemy at Caubul, Sale was holding out manfully
at Jellalabad. Whether the latter ought not to have
returned to Caubul, or if such a movement were impossible,
to have stood his ground at Gundamuck, is a question
which military critics will long continue to discuss. That
the appearance of this brigade at Caubul would have
changed the aspect of affairs at that place, and in all probability
rescued Elphinstone’s unhappy force from destruction,
and the national character from disgrace, there
seems no reason to doubt. But it was the opinion of
General Sale that his brigade could not reach Caubul.
“My retracing my steps on that city,” he says, “was, in
a military sense, impracticable, since the first inevitable
sacrifice would have been of the lives of 300 sick and
wounded, whom I could not have left in depôt with the
treasonable irregulars at Gundamuck, whilst my cattle
was unequal to the transport of my camp-equipage, and
my ammunition insufficient for protracted operations. In
the position which I occupied, I could not absolutely
command a day’s provisions, or even water, and should
have been hemmed in on every side by hostile tribes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
amounting to thirty or forty thousand men, part of whom
might have seized Jellalabad, and reduced it to ashes;
or, holding it, have left me no alternative but a disastrous
retreat to Peshawur. I therefore came to the resolution
of anticipating any movement of this kind, and, by possessing
myself of Jellalabad, establishing a point on
which the force at Caubul might retire if hardly pressed,
and restoring a link in the chain of communication with
our provinces.”</p>

<p>This was written five months after the brigade had
abandoned its position at Gundamuck. It does not,
however, differ much from the statement of reasons sent
to General Elphinstone only as many days afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
But the fact is, that those few days had given a very different
complexion to the aspect of affairs. It was on the
10th of November that Captain Macgregor, who for days
had been perplexed by alarming rumours of native origin,
received the first authentic intelligence of the outbreak at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Caubul, coupled with an urgent requisition from the
Envoy to bring back Sale’s brigade. Some, at least, of
the military objections urged against the movement by
the General had not then begun to exist. The irregulars
were not then known to be treasonable. The surrounding
country was not then known to be hostile. Food was
believed to be procurable. The brigade was at this time
halted in the valley of Gundamuck. There was no more
fertile spot than this between Caubul and Jellalabad.
Orchards and vineyards, green fields and rippling streams,
refreshed the eyes and gladdened the hearts of men who,
for many weary days, had been toiling through arid
defiles, under the shadow of dreary walls of rock. Here
the brigade had encamped itself on the 30th of October,
and looked forward to a brief season of repose.</p>

<p>Everything, indeed, at this time wore a most encouraging
aspect. Provisions were freely coming into camp,
and the Ghilzye chiefs were making their submission.
“On the 31st,” says Captain Macgregor, in his narrative
of these events, “Burkutt Khan paid me a visit,
and brought with him two of the rebel chiefs, Sadad
Meer and Sir Biland Khan; they had returned to their
allegiance, and delivered over to me sixteen camel loads
of property (not very valuable) which had been plundered
from some Rehwaree merchants; this property I
made over to their owners. Aghur Khan Sahuk, a
Ghilzye chief of considerable influence, and Attah Mahomed
Khan Sahuk, joined me at Gundamuck, and
established their Thanahs for the protection of the
Caubul road within their respective boundaries from
Seh Baba to near Jugdulluck. Burkutt Khan had reposted
his Thanahs at Jugdulluck, and at this time there
seemed to be a great promise of the Ghilzye country being
shortly tranquillised.”<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>There was one exception, however, to the general
amity which the chiefs seemed now inclined to offer to
Macgregor. Meer Afzool Khan, Urz-Begee, who was the
possessor of a fort and some circumjacent land at Mammoo-Khail,
about two miles distant from Sale’s camp at
Gundamuck, had fled from Caubul, and having sent his
family and his property to this fort, was now proceeding
to garrison it, and, in aid of the rebel cause, to molest us
by continued incursions upon our camp. On the 3rd or
4th of November,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> certain intelligence of this movement
was brought to Macgregor. He was then dining in the
mess-tent of the Sappers. With him were George Broadfoot,
who commanded the Sapper-corps (then ignorant of
the fate of his brother at Caubul)&mdash;and Backhouse and
Dawes, two stout-hearted officers of artillery. All were of
opinion with Macgregor that no time should be lost in
attacking the fort, before Afzool Khan had thrown his
reinforcements into it. So the political officer went at
once to the General’s tent, and urged him to sanction the
assault. His arguments were of no avail; and he returned
only to announce his failure. It was then midnight.
But the emergency was great; so Broadfoot and Backhouse
went at once to the tent of Captain Havelock of the
13th Light Infantry&mdash;than whom there was no finer
soldier or abler man in Sale’s camp&mdash;and roused him
from his bed to take counsel with them. The General
had much confidence in his judgment, and was more likely
to be moved by him than by any man in his force.
Fortunately, Havelock was eager for the attack; and
although he had already recommended it in vain, he undertook
to renew his solicitations, and to the delight of Broadfoot
and Backhouse partially succeeded. They desired an
immediate movement upon the rebel fort, and would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
had the necessary troops ready to march at daybreak.
But it was not until the fifth hour after noon that the
force received its orders to march. The enemy fled at its
approach, and the evacuated fort was garrisoned by a
party of the Shah’s troops under Captain Gerrard. A
commanding position was thus wrested from the enemy,
who were coming down to occupy it in force, and the
moral effects of the achievement were as great as its
immediate and material results. The spirits of the troops,
which had begun to flag, rose rapidly; and the enemy awoke
from their delusive belief that Sale was afraid to attack them.</p>

<p>Up to the day on which Macgregor received the pressing
solicitations of the Envoy to bring back Sale’s brigade
to Caubul, circumstances, since the arrival of the force at
Gundamuck, had been all in its favour. When, therefore,
Macnaghten’s letter was received, and they took counsel
together as to the course it then became them to pursue,
some at least of those strong reasons against the movement
on Caubul, which Sale set forth in his official letters, had
not yet been forced into being. A council of war was
held, and the members of it were divided in opinion; but
the majority pronounced against the movement for the
rescue of Elphinstone’s force. It was determined that the
brigade should throw itself into Jellalabad. There was a
middle course open to them&mdash;the retention of their position
at Gundamuck; but it seems to have found no favour
in their eyes. Had Sale’s force remained in the valley of
Gundamuck, it might have saved Elphinstone’s army from
annihilation on its fatal January retreat. As long as it
was encamped there, the tendency of the Ghilzye chiefs
was towards the establishment of friendly relations with
the British; but no sooner had we determined to abandon
our position, than the whole country broke out into
hostility, and the passes were sealed.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 11th of November, the brigade commenced its
march towards Jellalabad. Sale had wisely determined to
move with as little encumbrance of baggage as possible. He
was partly, indeed, compelled to this by the depredations
of the tribes who had swept off the bulk of his cattle whilst
the animals were grazing on the plain. The injury inflicted
upon us by their predatory adroitness was of a very
doubtful character. The taste for baggage is ordinarily
so strong that little short of absolute necessity compels its
abandonment. Sale was forced to move lightly out of
Gundamuck, and he found the advantage of the absence of
the usual impediments before he had been long on the
march.</p>

<p>To leave, however, any property at Gundamuck was
virtually to sacrifice it. To the care of the Shah’s irregulars
posted in the cantonment all that could not be
carried away was now consigned. As soon as Sale’s brigade
had commenced its march to Jellalabad the cantonment
was attacked. True to their character, the Janbaz,
who seem to have been raised for the express purpose of
going over to the enemy, did it with their wonted address.
The property left at Gundamuck fell into the hands of the
Afghans; the cantonment was burnt to the ground; and
all the surrounding country rose against us in open revolt.</p>

<p>Without any serious opposition, the march to Jellalabad
was accomplished. On the morning of the 12th, however,
soon after the brigade got under arms in the grey twilight,
the tribes were seen clustering on the steep hills on either
side, and soon poured themselves down on the rear-guard,
vainly striving to sweep off the baggage. A running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
skirmish, which lasted for some miles, and brought out the
fine qualities of our troops, their admirable discipline and
steadiness under fire, the gallantly of their bearing, and
the rapidity of their movements, ended in the complete
dispersion of the depredators, and secured the safety of
the remainder of their march. Clever were the manœuvres
by which on that day Dennie drew the enemy into
his toils, and heavy the retribution which descended upon
them. Placing his cavalry in ambush, he brought up his
infantry to the attack, ordered them to advance firing,
and then wheeled them about, as though in panic flight.
The stratagem succeeded to admiration. The enemy,
after a brief pause of wonderment, believed they had accomplished
a great victory, sent up a wild shout, and then
rushed in pursuit of the flying Feringhees. They were
soon in the clear open space to which Dennie had designed
to lure them. The cavalry, whom they had laughed at
on the hills, able now to operate freely, dashed at them
with sudden fury. The slaughter was tremendous; the
rout was complete. It was said of the British horsemen
that day that “their right arms were wearied with the
blows which they struck; and the quantity of dead that
might be seen scattered over the face of the valley proved
that they had not struck at random.”<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>On the morning of the 13th of November, Sale’s brigade
took possession of Jellalabad. The movement took the
Afghans by surprise. They had believed that the Feringhees
were making the best of their way to the provinces
of Hindostan; and now their entrance into the city struck
a panic into the hearts of the inhabitants. As the regiments
marched in, the citizens fled out in dismay. Everything
was abandoned to the British troops. There was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
need to fire a shot or to draw a sabre. Sale’s brigade had
now become the garrison of Jellalabad.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>Scarcely, however, had Sale made himself master of the
place before it was surrounded by yelling crowds, who
threatened death to the infidels if they did not at once
abandon the town. The utmost caution was now necessary.
The place, though surrounded by fortifications, was
absolutely without any real defences; and the troops
within its dilapidated walls and its filled up ditches, were
almost as much exposed as in the open country. The
extent of the works was very great, and it was quite
impossible to man them. But guards were posted at all
the gates; and a strong piquet planted in a central position,
and ordered to hold itself in readiness to send supports
to any point from which the sound of firing might
proceed.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> These arrangements made, the remainder of
the troops were suffered to lie down to rest by companies,
with their officers beside them, whilst Sale summoned the
commanders of regiments and detachments to a council of
war.</p>

<p>The question to be determined was this. There was the
extensive, ill-defended city of Jellalabad; and in the midst
of it was the Balla Hissar, or citadel, surrounded by a wall,
sufficiently extensive to enclose the brigade without inconvenience,
but yet not so extensive as to exhaust our means
of defence. It was now debated whether it would be more
expedient to abandon the town and concentrate our troops
in the Balla Hissar, or to hold possession of the former.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
Weighty and very apparent were the arguments in favour
of the occupation of the citadel; and for a time the
council seemed inclined towards the adoption of that
securer course; but to Dennie and others it was clear,
that the abandonment of the city would be a virtual
acknowledgment of weakness, and that it would have a far
better political effect, as it would a more becoming military
appearance, to hold the city itself, than to be cooped
up within the walls of the citadel. And so it was at last
determined that the city should be held, and the enemy
resolutely defied.</p>

<p>But to hold the city it was necessary that the defences
should be repaired. Well might Sale look with dismay at
their condition, and almost regard it as a wild hope ever
to look for the completion of the work that he had marked
out for his little garrison. “I found the walls of Jellalabad,”
he said, “in a state which might have justified
despair as to the possibility of defending them. The
<i>enceinte</i> was far too extensive for my small force, embracing
a circumference of upwards of 2300 yards. Its tracing
was vicious in the extreme; it had no parapet excepting
for a few hundred yards, which, there, was not more than
two feet high earth; and rubbish had accumulated to such
an extent about the ramparts, that there were roads in
various directions across and over them into the country.
There was a space of 400 yards together, on which none
of the garrison could show themselves excepting at one
spot: the population within was disaffected, and the whole
<i>enceinte</i> was surrounded by ruined forts, walls, mosques,
tombs, and gardens, from which a fire could be opened
upon the defenders at twenty and thirty yards.”<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>The first thing now to be done was to appoint a committee
of officers to examine and report upon the works of
the place. On the 13th of November, Captain Broadfoot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
who commanded the corps of sappers, with some other
officers, went round the dilapidated works. Broadfoot
alone succeeded in making the circuit of them. “Large
gaps cut off the communication, or insecure footing compelled
the officers to descend among the adjoining enclosures,
from which it was difficult to find the way; whilst
on the south side the rampart was so embedded in houses
and surrounded by them, that its course could only be
traced by laboriously threading the lanes of the native
town. On the north side the wall rose to a very great
height <i>towards the town</i>, but sloped down to the exterior
in a heap of ruins almost everywhere accessible; while at
the foot were houses and gardens so strongly occupied by
the enemy, that during the night of the 13th of November
our troops were unable to maintain their posts; and with
the exception of the gateway, a line of four hundred yards
on the northern face was without a man on the works.
Had the enemy then attacked us, we must have been
reduced to a street combat.”<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Broadfoot, now appointed garrison engineer, set about
the work entrusted to him with all the energy and zeal
for which his character was distinguished. His little corps
of sappers had brought with them their pickaxes, shovels,
and other working tools from Caubul; and were now ready
to ply them with the heartiest good-will. There was not
a soldier in garrison, European or Native, who was not
eager to join in the work. Wood was to be collected;
and iron was to be collected; for there were no available
supplies of either. But from the ruins of old houses in
the cantonment and in the town the former was extracted
in sufficient quantity, and the neighbouring country supplied
the latter.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Every difficulty was overcome as it arose.
Impossibilities did not grow in Jellalabad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>But before our soldiers could carry on their work in
safety upon the ramparts, it was necessary to give the
enemy, who assembled in great force beyond the walls of
the city, a taste of our military strength. The morning of
the 16th of November was an exciting, and it proved to
be a glorious one. On the preceding evening it had been
determined that Colonel Monteith, of the 35th Bengal
Infantry, a true soldier and a good officer, should take out
eleven hundred men, at daybreak, and give battle to the
molesting Afghans. As soon as the early dawn would
suffer him to take a survey of surrounding objects, Monteith
ascended to the flat house-top of one of the most
commanding edifices in the city, and looked around, with
a keen soldier’s eye, upon the expanse of hill and plain, of
garden and of vineyard, traced the course of the river, and
marked the castles of the chiefs which dotted the adjacent
country. He saw, too, what was of more importance still&mdash;the
dispositions of the enemy. There seemed to be
about 5000 fighting men, gathered together, some on the
hill-sides, some in the enclosures on the plain; and though
they were kept together by little discipline, there seemed
to be some sturdy qualities about them, and they were, at
all events, well armed. Monteith learnt all that could be
learnt from that commanding position, and then he went
down to place himself at the head of his men.</p>

<p>The little force was well composed and well commanded.
The remaining men of the garrison were under arms; and
the guns, which Monteith did not take with him, were
posted on the ramparts to cover his advance. Nothing
could have been more gallant or more successful than
the attack. What the artillery commenced, the infantry
followed up bravely, and the cavalry completed. The
enemy were beaten at all points. The wretched Janbaz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
who had gone over to the insurgents at Gundamuck, now
met the men of the 5th Cavalry in fair fight, and were
hewn down remorselessly by them. In a little time the
panic was complete. The British horsemen, following up
our successes, flung themselves upon the flying Afghans
on the plains, and slaughtered them as they fled. Then
the bugle sounded the recall: Monteith brought his men
together, flushed with success, and the whole returned, in
joyous spirits, to the city. The Afghans were checked at
the outset of their career of insolence and intimidation,
and for many a day kept themselves quietly in their homes.</p>

<p>Then the work of defence proceeded apace. Broadfoot
was toiling all day long to repair the decayed ramparts
and clear out the ditches, which, ditches no longer, had
been filled up to the consistency of thoroughfares. Abbott,
who had been appointed commissary of ordnance was
getting his guns into position, and making up his ammunition
as best he could from the materials to be found in
the neighbourhood. Macgregor, with his wonted activity,
was playing the part of the commissariat officer&mdash;and
playing it well&mdash;bringing all his political influence, which
was great, to bear upon the important business of the
collection of supplies. And so successful were his exertions&mdash;so
successful were the efforts of the foraging parties,
which went out from time to time in search of grain,
sheep, firewood, and other essentials&mdash;that in a little while
a month’s provisions were in store. It is true that the
men were on half-rations; but they did not work the
worse for that. It was never said at Jellalabad that the
soldiery were unequal to their accustomed duties because
they had not their accustomed supplies of food. The
gallant men who composed the garrison of Jellalabad, took
their half-rations cheerfully, and cheerfully did double
work.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>Not again, until the 1st of December, was the mettle
of Sale’s brigade tried in the open field. For some days
before, the enemy had been hovering about and threatening
the garrison, who, chary of their ammunition, which
was running scarce, gave back nothing in reply to the
desultory fire of the Afghans. But on the 1st of December
they appeared in such formidable array, and grew
so bold and menacing&mdash;closing in nearly and more nearly
about the walls, until the workmen on the ramparts could
not safely perform their accustomed duties&mdash;that Sale
could no longer refrain from sending out his fighting men
against them. Monteith, an officer of the Company’s
service, had led the attack on the 14th of November.
Now, the direction of the sortie was entrusted to an officer
of the Queen’s army, who had already, on more than one
occasion, shown his capacity for command. Dennie led
out the garrison this time; and gallantly they moved to
the attack. It was mid-day when they sallied out with a
cheer, and fell upon their besiegers. It were scarcely
truth to say that a battle was fought on that 1st of December.
The affair began and ended with the rout of the
Afghans. Two guns of Abbott’s battery were unlimbered,
and with murderous execution poured in their thick
showers of grape upon the discomfited mass. They, who
had of late been so bold and defiant, now fled in wild
confusion, but could not escape the sabres of our cavalry,
who charged them home, and drove them across the plain
into the river, whilst our infantry pursued them up the
hill-sides, and fell upon them with their gleaming bayonets.
And so, without the loss of a single man, Dennie dispersed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
the investing force; and not a trace of it was to be seen
on the morrow except the dead bodies on the plain.</p>

<p>And now, with little or no interruption, the labours of
the garrison proceeded, and the works began to assume an
appearance of effective defence. In fine health, in good
working condition, and in an admirable state of discipline,
European and Native troops alike laboured with axe and
shovel, and soon saw the mud-walls rising around them.
Had they thought only of themselves, they would have
toiled on, in high spirits as in high health. But the worst
rumours were coming in from Caubul. It was plain that
their fellow-soldiers at the capital were not achieving like
honourable success. It was believed, too, that Sale and
Macgregor knew more than they were willing to reveal.
Men asked each other fearful questions; but beyond the
leading outline of events, nothing was known that could
be shaped into intelligible replies.</p>

<p>How it happened that such an army as that commanded
by General Elphinstone had been so disastrously and disgracefully
beaten in the field by an enemy of such calibre
as these undisciplined Afghans, was a terrible mystery to
the brave men who had been scattering their besiegers like
sheep. They heard something of the want of provisions
that had reduced the force to this melancholy strait; but,
when Sale’s brigade sate down in Jellalabad, it had only
two days’ provisions. They heard, too, that the extent
and the weakness of the Caubul cantonments had paralysed
the efforts of the garrison; but there, at Jellalabad,
they had found their defences in a state of absolute ruin.
It seemed to them easy to obtain provisions, and to build
up their defences. At all events, they had done both;
and the troops at Caubul were of three or four times their
numerical strength.</p>

<p>Half of the month of December had worn away, when
a whisper went round the garrison that the Caubul force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
had capitulated. With mingled feelings of incredulity
and indignation the humiliating intelligence was received.
Sale and Macgregor knew only too well how Elphinstone
and Shelton had been throwing away chance after chance
of rescuing their miserable troops from destruction. But
it was not wise to damp the spirits of their own gallant
and successful garrison by any revelations of the unhappy
manner in which their old comrades had been sacrificed
at Caubul. When, therefore, on the 17th of December,
it was known that some disastrous intelligence had been
received from the capital, it was slowly believed that the
main body of the British army in Afghanistan had thrown
itself on the mercy of a barbarous foe.</p>

<p>But soon other intelligence of a grievous and afflicting
character was conveyed to the garrison. At first it appeared
only in the shape of a native rumour, which,
though it seemed to swell into the substantial proportions
of fact, was believed, with something perhaps of self-deception,
by Macgregor, to be only a shadowy figment
that he ought at once to dismiss from his mind. It was
rumoured that the British Envoy at Caubul had been
murdered, at a conference, by Akbar Khan; but Macgregor
argued, when communicating, on the 30th of December,
this report to the authorities below, that it was not
likely Macnaghten would have gone unattended to a
conference with the chiefs, or that Akbar Khan, whose
father and family were in the hands of the British, would
commit an act of such outrageous folly as to murder the
representative of the British Government. But Macgregor’s
incredulity was soon dispersed. After three days
of doubt, authentic tidings came in from Caubul to disquiet
the hearts of the British chiefs at Jellalabad. On
the second day of the new year, a letter was received
from Major Pottinger, full of the most painful and disheartening
intelligence. It announced the murder of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
Macnaghten. It announced that the Caubul force was
about immediately to abandon its position, and to fall
back upon Jellalabad, with every prospect of being
attacked by a faithless and infuriated enemy upon the
way. Into a few sentences of terrible significance was
crowded the record of these melancholy events. The
letter was written on Christmas-day:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr4">Caubul, December 25, 1841.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Macgregor</span>,</p>

<p>We have had a sad Comedy of Errors, or rather tragedy here.
Macnaghten was called out to a conference and murdered. We have
interchanged terms on the ground he was treating on for leaving
the country; but things are not finally settled. However, we are
to fall back on Jellalabad to-morrow or next day. In the present
disturbed state of the country we may expect opposition on
the road, and we are likely to suffer much from the cold and hunger,
as we expect to have no carriage for tents and superfluities. I have
taken charge of the Mission. Mackenzie, Lawrence, and Conolly are
all seized. The first two I fear for. The latter is quite safe. The
cantonment is now attacked.</p>

<p class="pr6">Yours, very truly,</p>
<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">Eldred Pottinger</span>.</p></div>

<p class="p1">With deep emotion the officers now discussed the
dangers of this fearful retreat through the snow, and the
too probable treachery of the chiefs; and there were
those among them who predicted that Elphinstone’s army
would be cut to pieces by the enemy, or destroyed by the
snow almost to a man. All this was very discouraging;
but the Jellalabad garrison were not in a temper to be
easily cast down. On they went from day to day, working
cheerfully at the defences&mdash;never fearing for themselves,
and, in spite of the evil prophecies of a few
amongst them, hoping the best for their miserable
comrades.</p>

<p>So passed the first week of January. To Sale and Macgregor
they were days of intense anxiety. Eagerly as
they looked for cheering intelligence from Caubul, nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
came to refresh them with new hopes. On the 8th of
January, another letter from Pottinger, dated the 28th of
December, was received by Macgregor. It was written
in French, as there were men in the enemy’s camp who
could read and interpret English;<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> and it announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
that the position of the British force at Caubul was
becoming more and more perilous&mdash;that the treaty commenced
by the late Envoy was still being negotiated&mdash;that
some delays had been occasioned by the difficulty,
real or pretended, of providing carriage and provisions to
enable the troops to commence their march; and that it
was not improbable that, in spite of the promises of the
chiefs, the British column would be compelled to fight its
way down to Jellalabad. In conclusion, Pottinger spoke
of instructions for the evacuation of Jellalabad that had
been despatched by Macnaghten, but urged Macgregor to
stand fast until the receipt of further orders from Caubul.</p>

<p>On the following day those further orders arrived. A
few horsemen appeared under the walls of Jellalabad, one
of whom was the bearer of a letter from the English
authorities at Caubul, addressed to Captain Macgregor.
It contained instructions for the evacuation of Jellalabad,
couched in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pr4">Caubul, December 29, 1841.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>It having been found necessary to conclude an agreement,
founded on that of the late Sir W. H. Macnaghten, for the evacuation
of Afghanistan by our troops, we have the honour to request that
you will intimate to the officer commanding at Jellalabad, our wish
that the troops now at that place should return to India, commencing
their march immediately after the receipt of this letter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
leaving all guns, the property of Dost Mahomed Khan, with the new
Governor, as also such stores and baggage as there may not be the
means of carrying away, and the provisions in store for our use on
arriving at Jellalabad.</p>

<p>Abdool Ghuffoor Khan, who is the bearer of this letter, will
render you all the assistance in his power. He has been appointed
Governor of Jellalabad on the part of the existing government.</p>

<p class="pr6">We have the honour to be, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="pr"><span class="smcap">Eldred Pottinger</span>, in charge of Caubul Mission.</p>
<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">W. K. Elphinstone</span>, Major-General.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Macgregor laid the letter before Sale, and a council of
war was held. It does not seem that there were many
doubts and misgivings to agitate and perplex the brave
men, who then asked each other whether they should
cast further discredit on their country, by abandoning
their post and flinging themselves into the snares of the
enemy. It seemed to them that a bait had been laid to
lure them to destruction. Macgregor knew that Akbar
Khan had issued a proclamation to the chiefs of the surrounding
country, calling upon them, as followers of the
true faith, to rise and slay the Feringhees on the road;
his voice was all for the retention of their post, and the
military chiefs were of the same temper. Little time
elapsed, therefore, before the following letter was written
to Major Pottinger and General Elphinstone:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr4">Jellalabad, January 9, 1842.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sirs</span>,</p>

<p>We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your
letter of the 29th ultimo, which you therein state was to be delivered
to us by Abdool Ghuffoor Khan, appointed Governor of this place
by the existing powers at Caubul. That communication was not
delivered to us by him, but by a messenger of his; and though dated
29th of December, 1841, has only this moment reached us. I have,
at the same time, positive information that Mahomed Akbar Khan
has sent a proclamation to all the chiefs in the neighbourhood,
urging them to raise their followers for the purpose of intercepting
and destroying the forces now at Jellalabad. Under these circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
we have deemed it our duty to await a further communication
from you, which we desire may point out the security which
may be given for our safe march to Peshawur.</p>

<p class="pi6">We have the honour to be, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="pi12"><span class="smcap">R. Sale</span>, Major-General.<br />
<span class="smcap">G. H. Macgregor</span>, Political Agent.</p></div>

<p class="p1">It is right that Macgregor and Sale should be suffered
to state in their own words, the motives which impelled
them to adopt this worthy resolution. “The conduct,”
wrote Captain Macgregor sometime afterwards, “of Major-General
Sir R. Sale and myself, in having declined, under
the circumstances, to deliver up Jellalabad to Abdool
Ghuffoor Khan, Barukzye, in conformity with the instructions
contained in the letter to my address of the
29th of December, signed by Major Pottinger and General
Elphinstone, has already been approved by government;
but perhaps it may be proper here to relate a few of the
causes which led to such a resolution. When the British
authorities at Caubul had decided upon capitulating, and
the terms of capitulation were in the course of negotiation,
my spies informed me that letters had been received from
Mahomed Akbar Khan and the Ghilzye chiefs, desiring
the different tribes on the road to assemble to attack the
British army, which was shortly to leave Caubul for
India. This information was confirmed by the letter from
Burkutt Khan ... An intercepted letter from
Mahomed Akbar Khan, which reached us at the same
time, will serve to show the spirit with which he regarded
us; therefore I felt convinced that treachery was intended
by the Afghan chiefs, in which case our retaining possession
of the fortress of Jellalabad became of incalculable advantage
to the retreating force; and if it succeeded in
reaching Jellalabad, strengthened as it would be by the
garrison, we might yet have upheld our authority in
Ningrahar, until an opportunity would have been afforded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
to the British Government to reinforce us, so as to commence
operations for the recapture of Caubul. The troops
left Caubul on the 6th of January; and not until the 9th
did we receive the letter in question. Their fate had
been sealed ere that period; and had the requisition been
complied with, Government would most undoubtedly have
had to lament the destruction of the Jellalabad garrison
as well as that of the Caubul force, the wishes of the
enemy evidently being to inveigle us into their power, and
then to do their worst towards us. Moreover, to have
evacuated Jellalabad would have doubtless increased a
hundred-fold the difficulties of re-establishing the British
authority in this country, in the event of Government
determining so to do. Our national honour, and the
safety of our Indian dominions, seemed to render this
latter course of paramount necessity.”<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>“As regards my own line of conduct,” said General Sale,
“in this difficult crisis, I am of opinion, in the absence of
all instructions from India, that I am at liberty to choose
between the alternatives of being bound or not by the
convention, which was forced from our Envoy and military
commander with the knives at their throats, according as
I see either one course or the other to be most conducive
to British interests. It does not absolutely impose any
obligation on my force, which is no party to it, and under
the consideration of its having been extorted by force,
unless it should be ratified by the Governor-General in
Council. If, therefore, I see a prospect of being re-inforced
from Peshawur within the period for which my provisions
and ammunition will last, I propose to hold this place on
the part of the government, until I receive its orders to
the contrary. If, however, any untoward incidents should
preclude the prospect of Brigadier Wild’s crossing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Khybur, I should esteem it wiser and better to retire upon
Peshawur, with the <i>débris</i> of the force of Caubul, on its
reaching me, than to remain here; but in no event would
I retire unsupported by other troops to Peshawur, unless
absolutely compelled to do so by the failure of food and
ammunition. I feel assured that the rebels at Caubul
dare not proceed to extremities with the force there, so
long as they know me to be strong here; and that I
should, therefore, be compromising them by evacuating
this place, until they have been permitted to retire upon
it.”<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>A season of painful anxiety and suspense followed the
receipt of the letter from Pottinger and Elphinstone.
But it was not without its alleviations. Money had
become scarce at Jellalabad. The cupidity of the Afghans
had seldom been proof against English money; and now
to lack the means of appealing to it was to lose one of our
principal means of defence. It was, therefore, with no
common delight that the garrison now welcomed the
arrival of a sum of money which Mackeson, ever strenuous
in his activity, had sent on from Peshawur, through the
agency of Tora-baz Khan, the loyal chief of Lalpoora.
The defences of the place, too, were rising under Broadfoot’s
hands, and “by the middle of January, the commencement
of the rainy season, a parapet, nowhere less
than six feet high, with a banquette as wide as the nature
of the rampart allowed, was completed entirely round the
place. The gates were repaired and strengthened by buttresses.
Two of them were re-trenched, and a ditch carried
round the north-west angle, whilst some of the most dangerous
ravines were laid open to our force, and roads were
opened into the low ground on the north side.”<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
was little, indeed, at this time, except a scarcity of ammunition,
to render the garrison apprehensive on their own
account; but every day made them more and more anxious
concerning the fate of their countrymen, who by this time
had left Caubul on their perilous retreat through the snowy
passes. A letter from Captain Lawrence, dated on the
4th instant,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> announced that the force was to march in a
day or two, with every expectation of being attacked upon
the road. Nothing could Sale’s brigade do in this emergency,
but patiently abide the result.</p>

<p>At last, on the 13th of January, when the garrison were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
busy on the works, toiling with axe and shovel, with their
arms piled and their accoutrements laid out close at hand,
a sentry, on the ramparts, looking out towards the Caubul
road, saw a solitary, white-faced horseman struggling on
towards the fort. The word was passed; the tidings
spread. Presently the ramparts were lined with officers,
looking out, with throbbing hearts, through unsteady telescopes,
or with straining eyes tracing the road. Slowly
and painfully, as though horse and rider both were in an
extremity of mortal weakness, the solitary mounted man
came reeling, tottering on. They saw that he was an
Englishman. On a wretched, weary pony, clinging, as one
sick or wounded, to its neck, he sate or rather leant forward;
and there were those who, as they watched his
progress, thought that he could never reach, unaided, the
walls of Jellalabad.</p>

<p>A shudder ran through the garrison. That solitary
horseman looked like the messenger of death. Few
doubted that he was the bearer of intelligence that would
fill their souls with horror and dismay. Their worst
forebodings seemed confirmed. There was the one man
who was to tell the story of the massacre of a great army.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
A party of cavalry were sent out to succour him. They
brought him in wounded, exhausted, half-dead. The messenger
was Dr. Brydon, and he now reported his belief
that he was the sole survivor of an army of some sixteen
thousand men.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">[January, 1842.]</p>

<p class="pch">The Retreat from Caubul&mdash;Departure of the Army&mdash;Attack on the
Rear-Guard&mdash;The First Day’s March&mdash;Encampment at Begramee&mdash;The
Passage of the Koord-Caubul Pass&mdash;Tezeen&mdash;Jugdulluck&mdash;Sufferings
of the Force&mdash;Negotiations with Akbar Khan&mdash;Massacre
at Gundamuck&mdash;Escape of Dr. Brydon.</p>


<p><span class="beg">The</span> story told by Dr. Brydon was one of which history
has few parallels. A British army, consisting of more
than four thousand fighting men and twelve thousand
camp-followers, had, as he confusedly related, disappeared
in a few days. Some had perished in the snow; others
had been destroyed by the knives and the jezails of
the enemy; and a few had been carried into captivity,
perhaps to perish even more miserably than their unhappy
comrades who had died in the deep passes of Koord-Caubul,
Tezeen, and Jugdulluck.</p>

<p>In the struggle between life and death which then
threatened to stifle the evidence of poor Brydon, he told
but imperfectly what he knew; and but imperfectly did
he know the whole dire history of that calamitous retreat.
It was long before the garrison of Jellalabad had more
than a dim perception of the events which ended in the
annihilation of the Caubul force. No one man could
speak of more than certain scenes of the great tragedy;
what had happened before, behind, around him, he could
only conjecture. But there were other survivors than
the solitary man who was brought, wounded and feeble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
into Jellalabad on that January morning; and enough
is now on record to enable the historian to group into
one intelligible whole all the crowded circumstances of that
lamentable retreat.</p>

<p>On the 6th of January, 1842, the army commanded by
General Elphinstone, which, for sixty-five days, had been
enduring such humiliation as never before had been borne
by a British force, prepared to consummate the work of
self-abasement by abandoning its position, and leaving the
trophies of war in the hands of an insolent enemy. A
breach had been cut, on the preceding day, by the
Engineer Sturt, through the low ramparts of the cantonments,
the earth of which bridged over the ditch; and
now through this opening, and through the rear gate, the
baggage filed out into the open plain, and the troops prepared
to follow it. It was a clear, bright, frosty morning.
The cold was intense. The snow was lying deep on the
ground. Shelton had recommended that the baggage
should be loaded by moon-rise; but it was not before
eight o’clock that it was ready to move. About half-past
nine the advanced-guard<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> moved out of the cantonments.
The English ladies and the children were with it; for it
was supposed to be the place of safety, if safety could be
found amidst the certain horrors of this perilous retreat.</p>

<p>It had been agreed that the chiefs should furnish a
strong Afghan escort to protect our retiring troops from
the furious zeal of the Ghazees, and the uncontrollable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
cupidity of those Afghan bandits who had all along looked
upon the revolution only as an opportunity for much
plunder. But the army commenced its march without
an escort; and the Newab Zemaun Khan, whose good
faith and true nobility of character are beyond suspicion,
despatched a letter to Pottinger, warning him of the danger
of leaving the cantonments without any such provision
for their safety.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> But it was too late now to stand still.
The Mission premises had already fallen into the hands of
the enemy; and could not be regained without an engagement,
which at such a time it was thought imprudent to
risk. Pottinger instructed Conolly, who remained as one
of our hostages with Zemaun Khan, to explain all this to
the Newab. The good old man admitted the cogency of
Pottinger’s arguments, and promised to do his best to
protect the retreating force. He fulfilled his promise to
the utmost of his ability; but he lacked the power to
restrain the people from perpetrating the outrages of
which long impunity had habituated them to the commission,
and made them regard themselves as the privileged
instruments of chartered violence and rapine.</p>

<p>The good intentions of the Newab are not to be denied;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
but the true policy of the British, on that January
morning, was to wait for nothing, however advantageous
in itself, but to push on with the utmost possible
despatch. But everything seemed to favour delay. The
passage of the Caubul river was to be accomplished by
means of a temporary bridge constructed of gun-waggons,
though the river was fordable at many places, and might
have been ridden or waded through without detriment to
those who had been struggling through the deep snow.
On this service, Sturt, active in spite of his wounds, was
employed from an early hour; but it seems that the
despatch of the gun-waggons was delayed, for some unexplained
reason, and it was not until the hour of noon
that the bridge was ready for the passage of the troops.
Shelton had endeavoured to expedite the movement;<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
but had met with his usual success. He went to the
General’s quarters&mdash;found him at breakfast; and returned
with nothing but a rebuke.</p>

<p>Had the whole of Elphinstone’s army crossed the
Caubul river before noon, and pushed on with all possible
despatch to Koord-Cabul, it might have been saved. But
the delays which arose on that dreadful morning, sealed
the fate of the unhappy force. It is hard, indeed, to say
when the force would have moved out of the cantonments,
if another effort had not been made to rouse the General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
to issue the necessary order. Colin Mackenzie, estimating
aright the fatal consequences of his chief’s hesitation,
hastened to Elphinstone’s quarters, and found him on
horseback before the door of his house, with characteristic
irresolution wondering what he ought to do. Eagerly did
Mackenzie point out that the stream of people, whose
egress from the cantonments was so much desired, had been
dammed up, and was now in a state of terrible stagnation&mdash;eagerly
did he call the attention of the General to the
crowds of Ghilzyes who had already begun to swarm into
the extensive enclosures of the British Mission-house&mdash;eagerly
did he beseech the hesitating chief either to issue
orders for the advance of the troops, or to recall them and
expel the intruding Afghans. And he did not implore
in vain. A reluctant assent to the onward movement of
the troops was wrung from the General; and Mackenzie
galloped back to communicate to Shelton the orders he
had received. But much mischief was already done. The
day was well-nigh lost. It was a day of suffering and
confusion, presaging worse suffering and confusion to
come. The advanced-guard under Brigadier Anquetil
moved out with some order and steadiness; but in a little
while the rush of camp-followers destroyed all semblance
of military array. They mixed themselves up with the
soldiers&mdash;a vast overwhelming assemblage of ten or twelve
thousand men. Not a mile of the distance had been
accomplished before it was seen how heavily this curse of
camp-followers sat upon the doomed army. It was vain
to attempt to manage this mighty mass of lawless and
suffering humanity. On they went, struggling through
the snow&mdash;making scant progress in their confusion and bewilderment&mdash;scarcely
knowing whether they were escaping,
or whether they were rushing on to death.</p>

<p>The main body under Brigadier Shelton, with its
immense strings of baggage-laden cattle, was moving out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
the cantonments during the greater part of the day. The
rear-guard manned the cantonment-walls, and looked down
upon a scene of uproar and confusion beyond the imagination
to conceive. The enemy, as the day advanced, began
to be busy at their work of plunder. Dashing in among
the baggage, they cut down the helpless camp-followers,
and carried off whatever they could seize. The snow was
soon plashed with blood. From the opening in the
ramparts to the bridge across the river streamed one great
tide of soldiers and camp-followers, camels and ponies;
and at the bridge there was an enormous mass of struggling
life, from which arose shouts, and yells, and oaths&mdash;an
indescribable uproar of discordant sounds; the bellowings
of the camels, the curses of the camel-drivers, the lamentations
of the Hindostanees, the shrieks of women, and
the cries of children; and the savage yells of the Ghazees
rising in barbarous triumph above them all.</p>

<p>So tedious was the exode of the force, such were the
embarrassments that beset its progress, that when the
shadows of evening began to descend upon this melancholy
scene, the rear-guard was still on the walls. At six
o’clock they marched out of the cantonments; and, moved
by one common thirst of plunder, the Afghans poured
themselves upon the abandoned homes of the English,
and, when they could not gratify their cupidity, began
to gratify their revenge. The Feringhees had left little
behind them. They had destroyed almost everything
which they could not carry away, except the guns,
which the General had deemed it expedient to leave in
good condition for the use of his “new allies.”<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> But at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
all events there were buildings standing there&mdash;buildings
erected by the English for their own purposes&mdash;insolent
monuments of the Feringhee invasion. The
work of the incendiary commenced. The Mission-house,
the General’s quarters, and other public buildings were
soon in a blaze; and the British army, now scattered over
the whole line of country between Caubul and Begramee,
some already at the halting-ground and others only now
starting on their dreary march, looked out through the
frosty night at the great conflagration, which lit up the
super-incumbent sky like a stormy sunset, and for miles
around reddened the great coverlid of snow.</p>

<p>Not until two hours after midnight did the rear-guard
reach its encamping ground, on the right bank of the
river, near Begramee. They had been under arms since
eight o’clock in the morning. They had been savagely
attacked on leaving the cantonments, and had left fifty of
their numbers dead or dying in the snow, and two of
their guns in the hands of the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> They had now
only accomplished five or six miles of their fearful
journey; but they had seen enough to fill them with
horrible forebodings of the fate that was in store for
them. The road was strewn with dying wretches,
smitten by the unendurable cold. The miserable people
of Hindostan&mdash;the weaker women and young children&mdash;had
already begun to lay themselves down to die
in the dreadful snow. Even the Sepoys were sinking
down on the line of march, and quietly awaiting death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>The night was one of suffering and horror. The snow
lay deep on the ground. There was no order&mdash;no
method in anything that was done. The different regiments
encamped anywhere. Soldiers and camp-followers
were huddled together in one inextricable mass of suffering
humanity. Horses, camels, and baggage-ponies were
mixed up confusedly with them. Nothing had been done
to render more endurable the rigour of the northern
winter.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> The weary wretches lay down to sleep&mdash;some
never rose again; others awoke to find themselves crippled
for life by the biting frost.</p>

<p>The morning dawned; and without any orders, without
an attempt to restrain them, the camp-followers and
baggage struggled on ahead, and many of the Sepoys
went on with them. Discipline was fast disappearing.
The regiments were dwindling down to the merest
skeletons. It was no longer a retreating army; it was
a rabble in chaotic flight. The enemy were pressing on
our rear; seizing our baggage; capturing our guns;<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
cutting up all in their way. Our soldiers, weary, feeble,
and frost-bitten, could make no stand against the fierce
charges of the Afghan horsemen. It seemed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
whole rear-guard would speedily be cut off. All thoughts
of effectual resistance were at an end. There was nothing
now to be hoped for, but from the forbearance of
the Afghan chiefs.</p>

<p>The Newab Zemaun Khan had ever been true to us:
ever in the midst of the wild excitement of the Caubul
outbreak, and in the flush of national triumph, he had
been serene, generous, and forbearing; had borne himself
as a worthy enemy; had been betrayed into no excesses;
but had endeavoured to vindicate the rights of the
Afghans, without inflicting upon the Feringhees the
misery and humiliation which others contemplated with
irrepressible delight. He had exerted himself on the
preceding day, to control the fierce passions of his
countrymen; and now he wrote to Major Pottinger, exhorting
him to arrest the progress of the retreating army,
and promising to send supplies of food and firewood, and
to disperse the fanatic bands which were hovering so
destructively on our flanks. Pottinger went to the General;
and the General consented to the halt.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Shelton,
on the other hand, was eager for an advance. He
believed that their only chance of safety lay in a rapid
forward movement, shaking off the baggage and camp-followers
as they went. In this conviction, he hurried
forward to Elphinstone, and implored him to proceed.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
But the General was not to be moved; and the doomed
army halted at Boot-Khak.</p>

<p>Here Akbar Khan appeared upon the scene. With
a body of some 600 horsemen he rode up, and Pottinger
saw him in the distance. Believing that he was a Sirdar
of note, the political chief despatched Captain Skinner,
with a flag of truce, to communicate with him. Skinner
brought back a friendly message. The Sirdar, he said,
had reproached the British authorities for their hasty
movement on the preceding morning; but added that
he had come out to protect them from the attacks of
the Ghazees. His instructions were to demand other
hostages, as security for the evacuation of Jellalabad;
and to arrest the progress of the force, supplying it in
the interval with everything it required, until such time
as intelligence of the retirement of Sale’s force should be
received. “It was too late to send a reply,” wrote Pottinger,
in his report of these proceedings, “and nothing
was determined&mdash;but some persons persuaded the General
to abandon his intention of marching by night.” And so
the doomed force, whilst the enemy were mustering to
block up the passes in advance, spent another night of
inactivity and suffering in the cruel snow.</p>

<p>It was at the entrance of the Koord-Caubul Pass that
the force, now on the evening of the 7th of January
having in two days accomplished a distance of only ten
miles,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> halted on some high ground. The confusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
far exceeded that of the preceding night. The great
<i>congeries</i> of men, women, and children, horses, ponies,
and camels, there wallowing in the snow, no words can
adequately describe. Many lay down only to find a
winding-sheet in the snow. There was no shelter&mdash;no
firewood&mdash;no food. The Sepoys burnt their caps and
accoutrements to obtain a little temporary warmth. One
officer<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> narrates how he and eleven others “crowded
round the hot ashes of a pistol-case, and with some bottles
of wine still remaining, tried to keep off the effect of the
cold. They then all huddled together and lay down on
the ground to sleep.”</p>

<p>The sun rose upon many stiffened corpses; and a scene
of still greater confusion than had marked the dawn of the
preceding morning now heralded the march of the force.
Doubt and uncertainty regarding the intentions of their
chiefs brooded over the officers of the force; but few of
the soldiers now remembered their chiefs, and the camp-followers
were wholly regardless of their wishes.</p>

<p>One paramount desire to escape death held possession of
that wretched multitude; and a crowd of soldiers and
camp-followers, at an early hour, began to push on confusedly
to the front. Whilst some efforts were being made
to restrain them, Akbar Khan was in communication with
the officers of the British Mission. Skinner again went
out to meet the Sirdar. It was proposed that the army
should either halt on their present ground at Boot-Khak,
or make their way to Tezeen, there to await intelligence of
the evacuation of Jellalabad. Four hostages were demanded
as security for Sale’s retreat; and Brigadier Shelton and
Captain Lawrence were named as two of them. But Shelton
had always resolutely refused to give himself up to the
enemy, and Elphinstone was unwilling to order him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
Pottinger, therefore, volunteered to take his place,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> and
Brigadier Anquetil consented, if a general officer were
peremptorily demanded, to accompany the political chief.</p>

<p>Pottinger rode to the rear, where Akbar Khan sent a
party of horsemen to conduct him to his presence. Welcoming
the young English officer with a respectful kindliness
of manner, the Sirdar declared himself willing to
receive three hostages&mdash;Major Pottinger, Captain Lawrence,
and any other officer whom the former might select.
Pottinger named Colin Mackenzie, than whom there was
not in all the army a braver or a better soldier,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and
those three officers placed themselves in the hands of
Akbar Khan.</p>

<p>The force was now again in motion. It was agreed
that they should push on to Tezeen, there to await certain
tidings of the evacuation of Jellalabad. Between Boot-Khak
and Tezeen lies the stupendous pass of Koord-Caubul.
For a distance of five miles it runs between
precipitous mountain-ranges, so narrow and so shut in on
either side that the wintry sun rarely penetrates its
gloomy recesses.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Into the jaws of this terrible defile the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
disorganised force now struggled in fearful confusion. In
vain did Akbar Khan issue his orders; in vain did his
principal adherents exert themselves to control the hordes
of fanatic Ghilzyes, who poured upon our struggling rabble
a deadly fire from their jezails. Nothing could restrain
the fierce impetuosity of our cruel assailants. Pent in
between the incumbent walls of the narrow pass, now
splashing through the mountain torrent, now floundering
through the snow which filled the hollows, or was banked
up beside the stream, the wretched fugitives fell an easy
prey to the Ghilzye marksmen, who shot them down from
the hill-sides. It was not a time to think of saving anything
but human life. Baggage, ammunition, public and
private property, were abandoned;<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and the Sepoys suffered
their very firelocks to be taken out of their hands.</p>

<p>The massacre was fearful in this Koord-Caubul Pass.
Three thousand men are said to have fallen under the
fire of the enemy, or to have dropped down paralysed and
exhausted, to be slaughtered by the Afghan knives. And
amidst these fearful scenes of carnage, through a shower
of matchlock balls, rode English ladies on horseback, or in
camel panniers, sometimes vainly endeavouring to keep
their children beneath their eyes, and losing them in the
confusion and bewilderment of the desolating march.</p>

<p>Many European officers perished in the Koord-Caubul
Pass. Among them was Captain Paton, the assistant
adjutant-general&mdash;a good and gallant officer who had lost
an arm in action at Caubul. Here, too, fell, mortally
stricken, Lieutenant Sturt of the engineers, a very fine
young officer, who, though severely wounded at the commencement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
of the outbreak, stabbed in the face at the
door of Shah Soojah’s presence-chamber, had exerted himself
with overflowing zeal and unfailing activity, whenever
his services, as the only engineer at Caubul, were required;
and whose voice, when others counselled unworthy concessions,
had ever been lifted up in favour of the noblest and
the manliest course. He lingered some little time, in
agony of body, but unbroken bravery of spirit, and died on
the 9th of January, attended by his wife and mother-in-law;
the daughter and wife of Sir Robert Sale.</p>

<p>That night the force again halted in the snow, now
deepened by a heavy fall, which, as the army neared
the high table-land of Koord-Caubul, had increased the
bitterness of the march.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The night was, like its predecessors,
one of intense suffering, spent by the perishing
troops without shelter, without firewood, and without food.
At early morn there was another rush of camp-followers
and undisciplined Sepoys to the front; but the march of
the troops, which had been ordered at ten o’clock, was
countermanded by the General. Akbar Khan was then
offering to supply the force with provisions, and to do his
best for its future protection. At his suggestion a halt
was ordered by Elphinstone; and the perishing troops
sate down in the snow, which another march would have
cleared, for a day of painful uncertainty. The whole
force was against the delay. Shelton went to the General
to remonstrate against it. In vain he urged that such a
measure would cause the total destruction of the column.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
The General was not to be moved from his purpose. The
day was one of idleness and desertion. The Native troops,
led by Shah Soojah’s cavalry, began to bethink themselves
of escaping from the horrors of the retreat by going over
to the enemy. The General had paraded the ruins of the
different regiments to repel an anticipated attack; and
now Captain Grant, the adjutant-general, accompanied by
the Tezeen chief, Khoda Bux Khan, rode to the head of
these skeleton corps, now numbering scarcely more than
a hundred men in each, and explained to them that Akbar
Khan had declared his intention to kill all, who deserted
to him, on the spot. But the contagion was then fast
spreading; and nothing could check the progress of the
disease. The Shah’s 2nd Cavalry had gone over nearly
to a man.</p>

<p>In the mean while Major Pottinger, who had passed the
night in a neighbouring castle, was in consultation with
Akbar Khan; and Captain Skinner was acting as the
vehicle of communication between them and the head-quarters
of the army. A new, and, at the first sound,
startling proposition was now made by the Sirdar. He
proposed that all the English ladies with the force should
be placed under his charge, that he might convey them
safely to Peshawur. Remembering that the families of
the Sirdar himself were prisoners in the hands of the
British, and believing that he was sincere in his desire to
save the ladies and children from the destruction that
awaited them on the line of march, Pottinger sanctioned
the proposal; and Skinner was despatched to the head-quarters
of the force to obtain the General’s consent.
“Desirous to remove the ladies and children, after the
horrors they had already witnessed, from the further
dangers of our camp, and hoping that, as from the very
commencement of the negotiations the Sirdar had shown
the greatest anxiety to have the married people as hostages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
this mark of trust might elicit a corresponding
feeling in him,”<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Elphinstone complied with the request.
A party of Afghan horse were in readiness to conduct
them to the presence of the Sirdar; and so Lady Macnaghten,
Lady Sale, and the other widows and wives of
the British officers, became the “guests” of the son of
Dost Mahomed Khan.</p>

<p>They did not go alone. The married men went with
them. The propriety of this step has been questioned.
It has been even said that they were not demanded at all
by Akbar Khan, but that they threw themselves spontaneously
upon the mercy of the chief. It is right,
therefore, that so grave a question should not be slurred
over. There were three unprejudiced witnesses, whose
statements, on such a point, would be worthy of acceptation,
as the statements of honourable and unprejudiced
men, familiar with all the circumstances of the case.
Major Pottinger, Captain Skinner, and General Elphinstone
knew all those circumstances, and had no reason to
misrepresent them. Major Pottinger says that, “on Sirdar
Mahomed Akbar Khan offering to take charge of the
ladies and protect them to Peshawur, I considered it
advisable to recommend that they should come over, as
the Sirdar’s family being in our hands was a sufficient
guarantee for their good treatment, and it was evident
that our own people were too much diminished to protect
them. Captain Skinner accordingly went over and mentioned
the offer to General Elphinstone, who approved
of it, and sent over the ladies, children, and married
officers.” Captain Skinner has left upon record no
narrative of these proceedings. But General Elphinstone
has distinctly stated that Captain Skinner was
sent to him with a proposal “that the married people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
and their families should be made over to him, promising
honourable treatment to the ladies.” Whatever may have
been the proposition, as it originally emanated from the
Sirdar, there is no room to doubt that General Elphinstone
shaped it into a recommendation that the husbands
should accompany their wives, and that the former went
over to Akbar Khan with the entire sanction of their
military chief.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>That the safety of the women and children was secured
by their removal from General Elphinstone’s disorganised
camp to the custody of Akbar Khan, is now a fact which
stands out distinctly in the broad light of historical truth.
But writing now after the event, it becomes one to consider
rather the wisdom of the experiment than the success
of the result. I believe that Pottinger and Elphinstone
judged wisely. There was a choice of evils, and it appears
to me that they chose the least. The women and the
children could not long have survived the horrors of that
perilous march. They had hitherto escaped, almost by
a miracle, the assaults of the cruel climate and the
inexorable foe. They were insufficiently clad. They had
no servants to attend upon them. They had scarcely
tasted food since they left Caubul. They had no shelter
during the frosty night-season. Some had just become, or
were about soon to become, mothers; and yet they had
been compelled to ride in jolting camel-panniers, or on the
backs of stumbling baggage-ponies. It was plain that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
Akbar Khan had no power to restrain the tribes who
were butchering our helpless people. The army was fast
melting away. It was doubtful whether a man would
reach Jellalabad in safety. To have left the women and
children to pursue their march would have been to have
left them to inevitable destruction. Akbar Khan might
be a man of violent and ferocious temper, and no very
scrupulous good faith; but because he had slain the
Envoy in a gust of passion, it did not necessarily follow
that he would betray the widow of his victim and the
other English ladies who were now to be entrusted to his
safe keeping. Moreover, if no sentiments of honour and
no feelings of compassion were within him, he might still
be swayed by motives of self-interest; and it was not
forgotten that his father, his brothers, and the ladies of
his family were prisoners in the hands of the British
Government, in the provinces of Hindostan.</p>

<p>The married officers and their families having gone over
to the Sirdar, the remnant of the doomed force on the
following morning (the 10th of January) resumed its march
towards Jellalabad. There was the same miserable confusion
as on the preceding morning. Soldiers and camp-followers
rushed promiscuously to the front. The Native regiments
were fast melting into nothing. Throwing down their
arms and crowding in among the mass of camp-followers,
the Sepoys were rapidly swelling the disorganised rabble
in front. Their hands were frost-bitten; they could not
pull a trigger; they were paralysed, panic-struck; they
rushed forward in aimless desperation, scarcely knowing
what they did or where they went; whilst the Afghans,
watching the cruel opportunity, came down, with their
long knives, amidst their unresisting victims, and slaughtered
them like sheep. “A narrow gorge between the
precipitous spurs of two hills” was the appointed shambles.
There the dead and the dying soon choked up the defile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
There was not now a single Sepoy left. Every particle of
baggage was gone. About fifty horse-artillerymen, with
one howitzer gun; some 250<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> men of the 44th; and 150
cavalry troopers, now constituted the entire force. Of the
16,000 men&mdash;soldiers and camp-followers&mdash;who had left
Caubul, not more than a quarter survived.</p>

<p>Still hovering on the flanks of our retreating force,
Akbar Khan, attended by a party of horsemen, watched
the butchery that was going on below; and when Elphinstone
sent Skinner to remonstrate with him, declared
that he was powerless to restrain the savage impetuosity
of the Ghilzyes, whom even their own immediate chiefs
could not control. But he had a proposal to make. Those
were not times when any very nice regard for the national
honour prompted the rejection of even humiliating terms
offered by our Afghan enemies; but when the Sirdar
proposed that the remnant of the British army should lay
down their arms, and place themselves entirely under his
protection, Elphinstone at once refused his consent. The
march was therefore resumed. The wreck of the British
force made its desperate way down the steep descents of
the Haft-Kotul, into a narrow defile, strewn with the ghastly
remains of the camp-followers and soldiers, who had
pushed on in advance of the column. As they passed
down the defile, the enemy opened a destructive fire on
their rear. The rear was then commanded by Shelton.
With a handful of Europeans he repulsed their attacks,
“though obliged to nurse their ammunition by a watchful
check on its expenditure.” “Nobly and heroically,” says
Shelton, in his rapid narrative of the march, “these fine
fellows stood by me.”<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> The gallantry of these few men
was, for a time, the salvation of the whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>After another attempt at negotiation, resulting only in
the same demand for the disarming of the remnant of the
force, it was determined, at Shelton’s suggestion, that a
desperate effort should be made to reach Jugdulluck by a
rapid night-march. Enfeebled by starvation, the troops
were little able to struggle forward, on their perilous
march, over a difficult country, and in the face of an active
enemy. But despair had given them strength; and when
the order was given, having spiked their last remaining
gun, they moved off lightly and quietly in the hope of
shaking off, under cover of the night, the curse of camp-followers,
which had sate upon them with such destructive
tenacity from the first. But no sooner had the soldiers
began to move, than the camp-followers started up to
accompany them; and throughout that fearful night-march
clustered around the few good fighting men and
paralysed the movements of the force.</p>

<p>It was a bright, frosty night. The snow was lying only
partially on the ground. For some miles they proceeded
unmolested. But when, at Seh-Baba, the enemy again
opened a fire upon their rear, the camp-followers rushed
to the front; and when firing was heard ahead of the
column, again fell back on the rear. Thus surging backwards
and forwards&mdash;the ebb and flow of a great tide of
people&mdash;these miserable camp-followers, in the wildness of
their fear, overwhelmed the handful of soldiers who were
still able and willing to show a front to the enemy, blocked
up the road, and presented to the eyes of the Afghan
marksmen a dark mass of humanity, which could not
escape their fire even under cover of the night.</p>

<p>Soon after daybreak the advance reached Kutter-Sung.
They were still ten miles from Jugdulluck. Halting only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
till the rear-guard had come up, they pushed on with an
energy, which at the commencement of the retreat might
have saved the force from destruction. But it was now
too late. The enemy were crowning the heights; there
was no possibility of escape. Shelton, with a few brave
men of the rear-guard, faced the overwhelming crowd of
Afghans with a determined courage worthy of British
soldiers; and fought his way to Jugdulluck. Almost
every inch of ground was contested. Gallantly did this
little band hold the enemy in check. Keeping the fierce
crowd from closing in upon the column, but suffering
terribly under the fire of their jezails, they made their
way at last to the ground where the advance had halted,
behind some ruined walls on a height by the road-side.
Their comrades received them with a cheer. The cheer
came from a party of officers, who had extended themselves
in line on the height to show an imposing front to
their assailants.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> The enemy seemed to increase in
number and in daring. They had followed the rear-guard
to Jugdulluck, and they now took possession of the
heights commanding the position of their victims.</p>

<p>The hot fire of the enemy’s jezails drove the survivors
of the Caubul army to seek safety behind the ruined walls,
near which they had posted themselves. Withdrawn from
the excitement of the actual conflict, these wretched men
now began to suffer in all their unendurable extremes the
agonies of hunger and thirst. They scooped up the snow
in their hands and greedily devoured it. But it only
increased their torments. There was a stream of pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
water near at hand, but they could not approach it
without being struck down by the fire of the enemy.
Behind the walls they had a brief respite; and they tried
to snatch a hasty meal. The ever active Commissariat
officer, Johnson, found among the camp-followers three
bullocks, which were instantly killed and served out to
the famishing European soldiers, who devoured, with
savage voracity, the raw and reeking flesh.</p>

<p>The respite was but of brief duration. A party of the
enemy’s horsemen was observed, and one of the number,
having approached our people, said that the chief who
commanded them was Akbar Khan. Skinner, who had
acted throughout as the negotiator, now went to remonstrate
with the Sirdar against the continued attacks of his
countrymen. He had scarcely set out, when the firing
was resumed. The men had lain down in the snow, to
snatch a little brief repose after a long vigil of thirty
hours, when the enemy poured in volley after volley
upon their resting-place, and compelled them, in wild confusion&mdash;soldiers
and camp-followers again huddled together&mdash;to
quit the walled enclosure in which they had
bivouacked. Individual acts of heroism were not wanting
at this time to give something of dignity even to this
melancholy retreat. A handful of the 44th Regiment
here made a gallant rush at the enemy and cleared all
the ground before them. Bygrave, the paymaster of the
Caubul army, was at their head. Thinking that our
whole force would follow them, the Afghans fled in dismay.
But the little party was soon recalled to the main body,
which again retired behind the ruined walls; and again
the enemy returned to pour upon them the destructive
fire of their terrible jezails.</p>

<p>All night long and throughout the next day the force
halted at Jugdulluck. In the mean while Akbar Khan
was in communication with the British chiefs. Skinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
had returned with a message from the Sirdar, inviting
the General, Brigadier Shelton, and Captain Johnson to
a conference. They went, and were received with every
possible demonstration of kindness and hospitality. A
cloth was spread on the ground. Food was placed
before them, and draughts of tea satisfied their thirst.
The meal completed, the Afghan chiefs and the English
officers sate round a blazing fire and conversed. Captain
Johnson was the spokesman on the part of the latter;
for he understood the language employed. Through him
the wishes of the General were now conveyed to Akbar
Khan. The Sirdar promised to send provisions and
water to the famishing troops,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> but insisted on retaining
the General, Shelton, and Johnson as hostages for the
evacuation of Jellalabad. Elphinstone earnestly entreated
permission to return to his troops&mdash;urged that, as commanding
officer of the force, his desertion would appear
dishonourable in the eyes of his countrymen, and promised,
on returning to camp, to send Brigadier Anquetil
in his place. But the Sirdar was inexorable; and so
General Elphinstone, Brigadier Shelton, and Captain
Johnson remained as hostages in the hands of Akbar
Khan. That night, under a tent provided for them by
the Sirdar, they laid themselves down in their cloaks,
and enjoyed such sleep as they only can know who have
spent such nights of horror as closed upon the sufferers
in this miserable retreat.</p>

<p>Next morning the conference was resumed. The
English officers earnestly implored the Sirdar to save the
remnant of the unhappy force; and he promised to exert
all the authority he possessed to restrain the tribes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
their unholy work of massacre and plunder. But the
petty chiefs of the country between Jugdulluck and Jellalabad
came flocking in; and it seemed impossible to
control the savage impulses of hatred and vindictiveness
which broke out even in the presence of the English
officers, and seemed to shut out all hope for the future.
They had trampled down every feeling of mercy and
compassion. Even avarice had ceased to be a moving
principle; offers of money were disregarded, and they
loudly declared that they wanted only the blood of the
Feringhees. In vain Akbar Khan tried to dissuade
them from their horrid purpose&mdash;in vain he urged that
his father and his family were prisoners in the hands of
the British Government; in vain the offer of large sums
of money for a safe conduct to Jellalabad was made to
these unrelenting chiefs. Johnson, who understood the
language well, heard them conversing in Persian; and it
was plain that they revelled in the thought of cutting
the throats of the Feringhees even more than of growing
rich on their plunder. They were not to be conciliated.
Akbar Khan made an effort to pacify them, and they
said in reply that they had recommended his father to
kill Burnes, lest he should return and bring an army
with him.</p>

<p>If there was any hope at this time it lay in an appeal
to the cupidity of their chiefs, but their hatred seemed to
overlay their avarice. Mahomed Shah Khan,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> however,
had undertaken to work upon their known love of money,
and asked whether the British were prepared to pay two
lakhs of rupees for safe conduct to Jellalabad. The
General had assented to this, and Mahomed Shah Khan
had undertaken the office of mediator; but it was long
before he could bring about any satisfactory arrangement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
At length, as the shades of evening were thickening
around them, he brought intelligence to the effect that
everything had been peaceably settled, and that the
remnant of the British army would be allowed to proceed
unmolested to Jellalabad.</p>

<p>But scarcely had he announced this consoling intelligence,
when the sound of firing was heard to issue from
the direction in which the British troops were bivouacked.
By the order of the General, Captain Johnson had written
to Brigadier Anquetil, upon whom now, as senior officer,
the command of the force had devolved, directing him to
have the troops in readiness to march at eight o’clock on
the following morning. But the letter had not been
despatched when the firing was heard, and it became
evident that the British troops were again on the move.
It was about eight o’clock, on the evening of the 12th,
that the few remaining men&mdash;now reduced to about a
hundred and twenty of the 44th, and twenty-five artillerymen&mdash;prepared
to resume their perilous march. The
curse of camp-followers clung to them still. The teeming
rabble again came huddling against the fighting men;
and the Afghans, taking advantage of the confusion, stole
in, knife in hand, amongst them, destroying all the
unarmed men in their way, and glutting themselves with
plunder.</p>

<p>They did not, this time, escape. The soldiers turned
and bayoneted the plunderers; and fought their way
bravely on. But there was a terrible fate awaiting them
as they advanced. The Jugdulluck Pass was before them.
The road ascends between the steep walls of this dark
precipitous defile, and our wretched men struggled
onward, exposed to the fire of the enemy, till on nearing
the summit they came suddenly upon a barricade, and
were thrown back in surprise and dismay. The enemy
had blocked up the mouth of the pass. Barriers, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
of bushes and the branches of trees, opposed the progress
of the column, and threw the whole into inextricable confusion.
The camp-followers crowded upon the soldiers,
who, in spite of the overwhelming superiority of the
enemy, fought with a desperate valour worthy of a better
fate. The Afghans had been lying in wait for the
miserable remnant of the British army, and were now
busy with their cruel knives and their unerring jezails.
The massacre was something terrible to contemplate.
Officers, soldiers, and camp-followers were stricken down
at the foot of the barricade. A few, strong in the energy
of desperation, managed to struggle through it. But
from that time all hope was at an end. There had ceased
to be a British army.</p>

<p>In this terrible Jugdulluck Pass many brave officers
fell with their swords in their hands. Up to this time
death had not been very busy among the commissioned
ranks of our ill-fated army. The number of officers that
survived, when the column left Jugdulluck, was large in
proportion to the number of soldiers who remained to
follow them. Though they had ever been in the midst
of danger, and had been especially marked by the Afghan
jezailchees, they had hitherto escaped with an impunity
which had not been the lot of the common soldiers. This
is to be attributed partly to external and partly to
internal advantages. They had enjoyed no better covering
and no better food than their comrades; but they
had ridden good horses; and though, outwardly, means
of keeping off the cruel cold had not been enjoyed by
them less scantily than by the European soldiers, they
had brought to their aid all the advantages of superior
mental resource. They had been more cautious and more
provident, and had been greatly upheld by the knowledge
of the responsibility which in such a fearful conjuncture
devolved upon them. There is a sustaining power, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
severe physical trial, in the sense of moral responsibility;
the feeling that others are dependent upon one’s exertions
has a bracing and invigorating effect; and whatever excites
mental activity is favourable to physical endurance. Many,
in the course of that terrible retreat from Caubul, had
perished under the influence of mental despondency;
many had been destroyed by their own incaution. The
officers had fallen only under the fire of the enemy.
Thousands of the soldiers and camp-followers had been
destroyed by the cruel cold.</p>

<p>But here, at this fearful Jugdulluck barrier, death struck
at the officers of the wretched force. Twelve of the best and
bravest here found their last resting-place.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Here fell Brigadier
Anquetil, upon whom, after the departure of Elphinstone
and Shelton, had devolved the command of the column.
He had been the chief of Shah Soojah’s force; was held in
esteem as a good officer; but during almost the entire
period of the siege had been incapacitated by sickness
from taking a prominent part in the military operations
which had ended in so much disaster and disgrace. Here,
too, fell Major Thain, who had gone out to India as the
friend and aid-de-camp of General Elphinstone, and in
that capacity had followed his chief to Caubul; but
throughout the time of their beleaguerment, and all
through the retreat, had been forward in the hour of
active danger, and had gallantly served as a regimental
officer whenever one was wanted to lead a charge. Here,
too, fell Colonel Chambers, who had commanded the
cavalry at Caubul, and who now, with other officers of his
regiment, perished in the attempt to clear the destroying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
barriers. And here, too, fell Captain Nicholl, of the
Horse Artillery, who with his men, all through the
dangers of the investment and the horrors of the retreat,
had borne themselves as gallantly as the best of English
soldiers in any place and at any time. Ever in the midst
of danger, now charging on horse and now on foot, were
those few resolute artillerymen. With mingled admiration
and awe the enemy marked the desperate courage of
the “red men,” and shrunk from a close conflict with
what seemed to be superhuman strength and endurance.
There is not much in the events of the outbreak at
Caubul and the retreat to Jellalabad to be looked back
upon with national pride; but the monumental column,
on which is inscribed the names of the brave men of
Nicholl’s troops, who then fell in action with the enemy,
only displays the language of simple, unostentatious truth
when it records that on “occasions of unprecedented trial,
officers and men upheld, in the most noble manner, the
character of the regiment to which they belonged;” and
years hence, when it has become a mere tradition that
Dum-Dum was once the head-quarters’ station of that
distinguished corps, the young artilleryman, standing in
the shadow of the column, will read how Nicholl’s troop,
the oldest in the regiment, was annihilated in the fearful
passes of Afghanistan, will dwell on the heroic conduct
which preceded their fall, and glow with pride at the
recollection that those brave men were a portion of the
regiment which now bears his name on its rolls.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>At this Jugdulluck barrier it may be said that the
Caubul force ceased to be. A few officers and a few men
cleared the barricade; and struggled on towards Gundamuck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
About daybreak they reached that place; and the
sun rose upon a party of some twenty officers and forty-five
European soldiers. The enemy were mustering around
them. “Every hut had poured forth its inhabitants to
murder and to plunder.”<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> There were not more than two
rounds of ammunition remaining in the pouches of our
men. But they had not lost all heart. “Their numbers
were as one to a hundred&mdash;most of them already
wounded,”<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> but they were resolute not to lay down their
arms whilst a spark of life remained. A messenger came
from the chief of the district with overtures to the senior
officer present. Major Griffiths, of the 37th Native
Infantry, was then the chief of that little band; but
whilst he was on his way to the Sirdar, the enemy mustering
around them called upon them to give up their arms.
The refusal of the brave men, followed by a violent
attempt to disarm them, brought on a hand to hand
contest. The infuriated mob overwhelmed the little party
of Englishmen, and cut them up almost to a man. Captain
Souter, of the 44th Regiment, who had wrapped the
regimental colour round his waist, and a few privates
were taken prisoners. The rest were all massacred at
Gundamuck.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>A few, however, had pushed on from Soorkhab, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
lies between Jugdulluck and Gundamuck, in advance of
the column. One by one they fell by the way, until the
number was reduced to six. Captains Bellew, Collyer,
and Hopkins, Lieutenant Bird, and Drs. Harpur and
Brydon, reached Futtehabad alive. They were then only
sixteen miles from Jellalabad. A prospect of salvation
opened out before them all; but only one was suffered to
escape. Some peasants in the vicinity of Futtehabad
came out, spoke to the fugitives, and offered them bread
to eat. They thought that a little food would strengthen
them to toil on to the end of their painful journey; and the
agonies of hunger were hard to endure. But again was
there death in delay. Whilst our officers tarried for a
few minutes to satisfy the cravings of nature, some of the
armed inhabitants of the place sallied out and attacked
them. Bellew and Bird were cut down. The others rode
off; but were pursued and overtaken; and three of the
remaining number were slain. Dr. Brydon alone escaped
to Jellalabad. Wounded, and worn out by famine and
fatigue, he had struggled onward, borne by a jaded pony,
till the walls of the fort appeared in sight; and a party
came out to succour him.</p>

<p>So perished the last remnant of a force which had left
Caubul numbering 4,500 fighting men and 12,000 camp-followers.
The frost and the snow had destroyed more
than the jezails and the knives of the Afghans. It was
not a human enemy alone with which those miserable men
had to contend. It was theirs to war against a climate
more perilous in its hostility than the inexorable foe. But
neither the cruel cold nor the malignant Afghans would
have consigned the British army to destruction, if the
curse which had so long brooded over the councils of our
military chiefs, and turned everything into folly and
imbecility, had not followed them on their exode from the
Caubul cantonments, and crowned the catalogue of disaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
and disgrace. It is probable that, if greater energy had
been exhibited at the commencement of the retreat&mdash;if
nothing had been thought of but the best means of
accomplishing the march through the snow with the
utmost possible rapidity&mdash;a large portion of the force
would have been saved. But the delays which were
suffered to arise at the commencement of the retreat
sealed the fate of the army. They threw the game into
the hands of the enemy. We waited, indeed, whilst the
gates were being closed upon us, and then there was no
outlet of escape. Whilst our wretched people were halting
and perishing in the snow, the enemy were gathering in
advance of them and lining the passes, intent on their
destruction. The events of that miserable week in
January afforded a fitting climax to the series of disasters
which had darkened the two preceding months. There is
nothing, indeed, more remarkable in the history of the
world than the awful completeness&mdash;the sublime unity&mdash;of
this Caubul tragedy.</p>

<p>It would be unprofitable to enter into an inquiry
regarding all the minute details of misdirection and mismanagement,
making up the great sum of human folly,
which was the permitted means of our overthrow. In the
pages of a heathen writer over such a story as this would
be cast the shadow of a tremendous Nemesis. The
Christian historian uses other words, but the same prevailing
idea runs, like a great river, through his narrative;
and the reader recognises the one great truth, that the
wisdom of our statesmen is but foolishness, and the might
of our armies is but weakness, when the curse of God is
sitting heavily upon an unholy cause. “For the Lord
God of recompenses shall surely requite.”</p>

<p class="pc2 large">NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS.</p>


<p class="pc1 lmid">THE MACADAMISATION OF THE PUNJAB.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Book IV., chapter 2, page 48.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">“The plot is thickening,” wrote Macnaghten, on the 10th
of April, “and I have no hesitation in asserting my belief
that we shall find ourselves in a very awkward predicament,
unless we adopt measures for macadamising the road through
the Punjab.” On the 15th of the same month he wrote:
“It may not be the interest of our neighbours to give us
offence; but it is their interest to do us injury, and in
attempts to effect this, a certain good neighbour has certainly
been most active and persevering. We have fresh instances
and clear proof of this spirit daily. Nothing would give us
a greater name in Central Asia than success in such a
cause; but I need not dilate on the ten thousand advantages
that would attend a vigorous policy in this direction.”&mdash;[<i>MS.
Correspondence.</i>] Avitabile’s proceedings at this
time were a source of extreme annoyance to Macnaghten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
The General was interfering with the Khyburees. The
Koochlee-Khail tribe of Afreedis, from whom he demanded
revenue, went to Mackeson for protection, and said:
“Formerly the Sikhs used to pay us 13,000 rupees a year
to get water at Jumrood; and now, on the strength of their
alliance with you, they ask us for revenue.”&mdash;[<i>Lieutenant
Mackeson: April 12, 1840. MS. Correspondence.</i>] The
chief of the tribe said to Mackeson: “Why do you stay at
Peshawur? You are powerless there, and you prevent us
from injuring the Sikhs in return for the injuries they inflict
upon us. Come and tarry with us.” Avitabile threatened
to carry fire and sword among the Koochlee-Khail people;
and Mackeson, to prevent the employment of force, went
security for them. Besides this, he laid an embargo on all
merchants and travellers, subjects of Shah Soojah, passing
through Peshawur, and declared that not one of them should
proceed until the Shah had given ample security against
the commission of robberies in the pass.&mdash;[<i>Lieutenant
Mackeson to Mr. Maddock: April 26. MS. Correspondence.</i>]
These things greatly embarrassed our position, at a
time when we especially desired to tranquillise the Khyburees.
Macnaghten wrote urgently to government on the
subject: “By this day’s dawk I am sending to the Supreme
Government,” he wrote, in a private letter, on the 23rd of
April, “a budget containing the proceedings of General
Avitabile. These are calculated to do infinite mischief&mdash;so
much so, indeed, that unless redress is afforded, I do not
see how it is possible that a rupture with the Sikh Government
can be avoided; it’s a necessary consequence of such
proceedings; all our ties must be renewed in the pass, and
commerce by this route may be extinguished. Can the
<i>Volpe</i> be acting without instructions? Why should he seek
to exasperate us? But our convoy has got safely through,
and we are on the best possible terms with the Khyburees,
who detest our allies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>


<p class="pc2">THE MISSION TO KOKUND.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Book IV., chapter 2, page 70.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">The grounds upon which Macnaghten proceeded in this
matter, as well as the recognised objects of the Mission, may
be gathered from the following passages of a letter to the
Supreme Government: “Referring, therefore, to the general
permission accorded in the Secretary’s letter of the 11th of
May last, on the point of Captain Conolly’s mission to Kokund,
I have come to the determination of at once sending
off that officer to the Court in question by the route of
Khiva, and in company with Yakoob Bai, the Khan Huzzrut’s
envoy here, who is anxious to return home. Yakoob
Bai will be a good escort for Captain Conolly through the
whole of the desert country extending from the Hindoo-Koosh
to Khiva, and thence, as shown by the memorandum
of the envoy’s conversation with me on the 13th of June
last, his way will be safe and easy on to Kokund, the ruler
of which place can be directly advised of his approach. His
Lordship in Council has himself been pleased to express his
sense of Captain Conolly’s qualifications for the duty proposed
to be entrusted to him, and I venture to hope that
this Mission will give great support to our position in
Afghanistan, besides being the means of obtaining other
important advantages. I have so repeatedly had the honour
of laying before the Right Honourable the Governor-General
my opinions as to the affairs of Toorkistan, that I need not
repeat them. I will do myself the honour of forwarding
on another occasion my specific instructions to Captain
Conolly for his journey, which will have for its chief object
the establishment of a correct impression, at every place
which he visits, of British policy and strength, as it bears
upon Asia and on Europe, with reference especially to the
late interference in Afghanistan&mdash;the strengthening of
amicable relations with the chief Oosbeg powers, which have
shown a friendly disposition towards us, and endeavouring
to persuade them to help themselves, and enable us to help
them, by doing present justice to their enemies, and forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
an agreement with each other to prevent or to redress future
injury done by any one party among them to Russia, so as
to deprive the latter power of pretexts for interference with
their independence. Captain Conolly will either at Khiva
or Kokund learn the result of the endeavour committed to
the two deputies of Shah Soojah, mentioned in my letter of
yesterday, to bring the Ameer of Bokhara to reason. If by
this influence, or by other means, the Ameer should promptly
exhibit a decided disposition to atone for his past, and to be
friends with us and the Afghan King, Captain Conolly can
return to Afghanistan <i>viâ</i> Bokhara, otherwise his course must
be regulated by circumstances.”&mdash;[<i>Sir W. H. Macnaghten
to Government: Caubul, August 2, 1842. MS. Correspondence.</i>]
I have taken this from a copy in Arthur
Conolly’s hand-writing.</p>


<p class="pc2">SOURCES OF DOURANEE DISCONTENT.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Book III., chapter 3, page 105.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">“It is curious to observe the manner in which the Douranees
have reasoned upon the liberality of his Majesty’s
Government, and the gradual modifications which we may
suppose their feelings to have undergone, from the evidence
of alterations in their tone and conduct. During the first
year of his Majesty’s restored government, they exhibited
outwardly but little change from the same passive demeanour
which had characterised their submission to the Sirdars
under the later periods of the Barukzye administration. No
sooner, however, had the new order been issued for the
remission of the land-tax, than, with resuscitated hopes, they
began to remonstrate, to agitate, and ultimately to take up
arms, when other means of intimidation failed them. I bring
forward, by way of illustration, the example of the tribes
in Zemindawer. They had been subjected, during the preceding
year, to some severity of treatment by the financial
arrangements of Wullee Mahomed Khan; but they had
endured the yoke almost without a murmur. Since the
arrival of the Wukeel at Candahar they had been, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
contrary, entirely free from interference. Not a government
agent of any class had appeared in Zemindawer, nor had a
khurwar of grain been realised, yet the tribes of that district,
on the first demand of revenue, took up arms to withstand,
as they said, oppressive exactions; and whilst a party
of horse were encamped upon this side of the Helmund,
appointed to support the government officer in his collections,
they crossed the river, and attacked them without the
semblance of an excuse on the score of provocation or actual
rapacity. The unpopularity of the agent deputed to realise
the revenues, and the apprehension of a repetition of the
exactions of the previous year, may have been instrumental
in assembling the tribes in arms as a measure of defence;
but surely such motives are insufficient to justify or explain
a gratuitous attack before the collections of the present year
had commenced; or, if the motives which the Zemindawerees
assigned for their offensive hostility be admitted, surely
some radical change of character must have taken place, to
have emboldened to this act of aggressive rebellion tribes
who had submitted passively to the most galling tyranny
on the part of the Sirdars, and who had even yielded, since
the accession of his Majesty, to the harshness of the collections
of the preceding year without betraying any open
signs of discontent. It appears to me that, had the land-tax
on the <i>Tajul Kulbas</i> been continued, the tribes in Zemindawer,
seeing no indication of a change in the policy of the
government, and conscious that the power of coercion was
stronger at the present than at any previous time, would
never have dreamed of assembling in arms to resist the
royal authority; and that we must consequently attribute
to the exercise of his Majesty’s clemency, and to the impression
which had arisen from it, that it was the aim of
the government to manage the Douranees through the agency
of their hopes rather than of their fears, and that rebellion
might thus be attempted with impunity, so sudden and
unusual a display of boldness as could induce the tribes to
rise in arms and attack a government agent, however, and
perhaps deservedly, unpopular.”&mdash;[<i>Major Rawlinson’s Douranee
Report. MS. Records.</i>]</p>

<p class="pc2">THE QUESTION OF AN ADVANCE UPON HERAT.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Chapter III., page 115.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">Sir Jasper Nicolls, as Commander-in-Chief, had always
consistently opposed the advance to Herat, on the grounds
that we had not troops for the purpose, and, as a Member
of Council, on the grounds that we had not money. On the
18th of August, 1840, on returning some papers to Lord
Auckland, he wrote to the Governor-General: “I am glad
that your Lordship has repressed the anxiety to annex Herat
again to Caubul in the way hinted at. Were Afghanistan
ours, we should, perhaps, be compelled to make Herat our
advanced post! it is really the gate of India. The problem
is solved in a military sense; politically, it remains with
your Lordship and the authorities at home, acting on your
views. To show front at Herat, and at some selected point
on or near the Oxus, we should be very strong in Afghanistan.
The elements of stability are sadly deficient there,
and two quicksands interpose between Candahar and Caubul
and our own provinces. I mean the Punjab and the Ameers’
country. Being out of India, we cannot keep such establishments
as will be required there without a large
augmentation of our army, and this without any perceptible
increase of revenue. I very much doubt that Shah
Soojah will ever be able to support himself. With this
opinion, and seeing here the relief is given up on account
of six regiments only, we may feel some apprehension that
our numbers are at this moment too low. Discontent may
follow.” “I wanted him,” adds Sir Jasper Nicolls, in his
private journal, “to feel that we cannot go further, or
even retain seven regiments in Afghanistan without increase
of force. We shall maintain ourselves there with difficulty.
Yet all the young diplomatists want to aid Khiva&mdash;occupy
Balkh&mdash;threaten Bokhara&mdash;and, lastly seize Herat before
its traitor Vizier may give it up to Persia and Russia. We
are beset with hollow friends in that quarter.” “Lord
Auckland said nothing of importance in reply, and did not
allude to it next day in Council.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 15th of March (on which day intelligence of Todd’s
departure was received by the supreme Government), Sir
Jasper Nicolls wrote, after Council, in his journal: “Lord
Auckland had prohibited any advance. This accorded with
my often-expressed opinion that we are too much extended
already; but when I signed my assent to-day in Council
to his letters, I whispered to him, that if Herat was to be
occupied by us against the will of the Vizier, the present
circumstances were very propitious. We had a large body
of troops at hand, and probably their plans were not
matured.” On the 26th he wrote: “Lord Auckland
sent home a long minute regarding Herat, which he means
to leave as it is, unless the Persians should show that they
were anxious to lay hands upon it. He means to preserve
our footing in Afghanistan.”</p>

<p>In what manner the home authorities regarded the Herat
question may be gathered from another passage in Sir
Jasper Nicolls’ journal: “<i>August 19, 1841.</i>&mdash;I wrote a
hasty paper to-day, and a short one, against the occupation
of Herat, if it can possibly be avoided. It was no sooner
written than orders were received to seize it, if the Persians
made any preparations to attach any part of Kamran’s
dominions to their own. I wrote in the way of warning.
Lord A. also advised the government not to carry our arms
further before this despatch was received. I only fully
expressed my opinion that we are not justified in risking
the revenues of India for anything external. As this subject
may be brought unpleasantly forward, I shall just note
that, by the June mail, we received a letter desiring us to
take Herat. There was by the same mail a later despatch,
not so anxious about it, or more cautious. I thought Lord
Auckland’s minute alluded to the June letter, and very
desirous to damp our ardour in carrying on hostilities, and
spending our money so far out of India, I wrote as I did.
Two hours after my paper was sent in, I received for perusal
the Secret Committee’s despatch of July, enclosing Lord
Palmerston’s directions to check Persia in this object. They
will not look for any difficulty to be started by me; but
really I am most deeply impressed by a conviction that a
continuance of so large a force, and of such expenditure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
beyond the Indus, will go far to break us down. I have
no desire to embarrass the question, or to take a distorted
view of it. We all concurred with Lord Auckland, except
Prinsep. He thinks that we must displace Yar Mahomed,
and he apprehends nothing from the distance or expenditure,
in comparison with what must follow from his keeping
Afghanistan in revolt. My argument as to the intolerable
drain was taken from his minute of March.” Again, on
the 31st of August, Sir Jasper wrote: “Weekly we expend
large sums upon the Shah and the country&mdash;not only in
allowances, salaries, supplies, stores, pensions, compensations,
and numberless contingencies; but barracks, stables, forts,
magazines, and even a long causeway in Cutchee. Yet no
return can ever be made. <i>To crown all&mdash;the blister, Herat!</i>”&mdash;[<i>MS.

<p class="pc2">THE CAUBUL CANTONMENTS.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Book IV., chapter 4, pp. 141&mdash;142.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">“Occupied with the reception of Shah-zadah Timour,
with the foregoing expeditions and detachments, and with
the establishment of the Shah’s Court and of his civil
administration, Macnaghten for some time neglected to
consider how the troops which he kept at Caubul, were to
be lodged. The question was one demanding instant
decision, as the winter of 1839 was rapidly approaching,
and there was no suitable cover for troops. Though pressed
upon this subject, as soon as it was decided that a portion
of the British army was to remain, it was not until the end
of August that any steps were taken in this important
matter; and then they consented in sending an engineer
officer, Lieutenant Durand, accompanied by Mohun Lal, to
examine three small forts, which Burnes had reported as
affording a suitable position for the troops. These diminutive
forts were west of Caubul several miles; and having
neither cover, space, water, nor in fact any other requisite
for the convenience of the troops, and being, in a military
point of view, ill-placed as a position for the force, were at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
once rejected by the engineer, who considered that it was
essential to have military possession of the Balla Hissar;
and that it was the proper place, under every point of view,
both with reference to the present and the future, for
lodging the troops. The Shah, upon various pretences,
opposed this measure of precaution, and Macnaghten yielded
to objections which he felt and acknowledged to be ridiculous.
Sale was to be left in command at Caubul; and he
had therefore a voice in the selection of the locality for the
cantonment of his force. The engineer, however, stated
that it was impossible, before the winter set in&mdash;that is, in
the course of six weeks&mdash;to build barracks, hospitals, sheds
and stables for a brigade, and its attached cavalry and guns,
outside the Balla Hissar&mdash;building material having as yet to
be made and collected; whereas, inside the Balla Hissar,
by taking advantage of what already existed, it was possible
to obtain good and sufficient cover. Thus circumstanced, a
reluctant consent was extracted from the Shah, and the
pioneers of the force were immediately set to work, with the
view of rendering the citadel a strong work, with cover for
its garrison, stores, and ammunition. The Shah no sooner
learned that the work was seriously commenced, than he
renewed strenuously his objections, urging that the citadel
overlooked his own palace and the city; that its occupation
would make him unpopular, as the feelings of the inhabitants
would be hurt; and that he had already received
strong remonstrances against the measure. Macnaghten,
with fatal weakness, yielded; and peremptory orders were
issued for the discontinuance of the work. Foiled in his
avowed purpose of rendering the citadel a post, which, with
a thousand men, a few guns, and proper provisions, might
be held against all that Afghanistan could bring before it,
the engineer was forced to content himself with keeping such
hold of the Balla Hissar as admitted of its citadel being
occupied at any moment, by lodging the troops in hastily-prepared
accommodation at its base. It seemed, indeed,
that the troops, being once in military possession of the
Balla Hissar, the evacuation of that stronghold in future
was an event as improbable as it would be impolitic, and
that the occupation of the citadel and the repair of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
works would in time inevitably follow. Macnaghten could
not but coincide with the engineer and those who succeeded
him and held similar views; and, as the cost would have
been trifling in comparison with the sums thrown away in
Afghanistan upon objects to which political importance was
attached, the Envoy for some time contemplated following
up the project. But the Shah and Kuzzilbash party, as
well as the Afghans, were very averse to a measure which,
so long as the British troops remained in Afghanistan, would
keep Caubul subject to their effectual control; and Macnaghten,
being in the false position of having to reconcile
the declared intention of the government to withdraw the
army from Afghanistan with its present actual military
occupation in force, wavered on the adoption of necessary
measures of precaution, which might countenance the
suspicion of a purpose on the part of the British Government
permanently to hold the country; and, ultimately, in
an evil hour for himself and his country’s arms, not only
entirely neglected such salutary precaution, but gave up the
barracks constructed in the Balla Hissar to the Shah as
accommodation for his Harem, evacuated the fort, and
thought no more, until too late, of strengthening himself
therein.”&mdash;[<i>Calcutta Review.</i>]</p>

<p class="p2">To this, the authenticity of which is unquestionable, may
be advantageously appended the following</p>

<p class="pc2">MEMORANDUM BY BRIGADIER A. ROBERTS, C.B.</p>

<p class="p1">“The king, with the envoy and staff, spent the winter of
1839 at Jellalabad. I was one of the party, as I then
commanded the Shah’s troops. We all arrived at Caubul
early in May of 1840. Sturt of the Engineers, was stationed
at Caubul to fit up buildings for the troops and to
construct new barracks. Soon after my arrival at Caubul,
I looked at the ground selected by the engineer for barracks;
and considering his plan most objectionable (which
was long ranges of buildings the same as at Caunpore or
Meerutt), for a country where the cold in winter was intense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
and where no person considered life secure outside
of a fort, I wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr4">Caubul, 9th May, 1840.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sturt</span>,</p>

<p>Is it decided for what troops you are building barracks? for
if the Shah’s force is to be accommodated, I should like to suggest
some alterations. Instead of having separate buildings for each
company, I would strongly recommend squares for wings or regiments;
the latter I would prefer, as I think they would possess
many advantages for this country:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Much less ground would be necessary.</p>

<p>2. One fourth of the sentries would not be required.</p>

<p>3. For European regiments visiting officers would find them much
more convenient, and all bad characters could be prevented roving
about the country.</p>

<p>4. With a parapet wall they could be easily defended, and which
would be an object in the event of the troops being called away.</p>

<p>5. And I should think that the men being sheltered from the
piercing cold and winds in winter would render them much less
liable to the attacks in the lungs, which have proved so fatal.</p>

<p>6. Independent of the foregoing advantages, buildings so constructed
would be better adapted for stores or serais, and if built in
échêllon, could be easily defended.</p>

<p>I hope you will agree with me; however, I can have nothing to
do with the plan, unless the Shah’s troops are to be accommodated.</p>

<p class="pr4">Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr"><span class="smcap">A. Roberts</span>.</p></div>

<p class="p1">“I was induced to write as above because many of the 13th
Foot had died at Caubul during the winter from complaints
in the lungs. The snow remains on the ground for a considerable
time; the natives were expert thieves and assassins,
and ten ranges of barracks would require at least sixty
sentries. The Europeans would ramble, and no man was
safe beyond the limit of cantonments.</p>

<p>“Upon a further examination of the ground I saw the site
chosen was very objectionable, a small river running between
it and the Balla Hissar, and it was, besides, commanded in
two places. I received the following reply:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr4">Caubul, 10th May, 1840.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brigadier</span>,</p>

<p>I believe there is no chance at present of the Shah’s force
occupying the cantonments, as I am now portioning off the ground
for the general staff of Sir Willoughby Cotton. Your recommendation,
however, has come too late, for I have laid the foundation of
one-half.</p>

<p>I know little about what is convenient or not. I submitted a
plan to Sir W. Macnaghten. Whether it went farther than his
military councils, I cannot say; but as I heard no more about it, I
took silence for consent, and worked away.</p>

<p>Now the most must be made of it; but the barracks of one regiment
will be of no great extent as it is, and will form a rectangle of
350 and 500 feet.</p>

<p>But it is useless questioning the expediency or otherwise now of
any plan.</p>

<p class="pr6">Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4">(Signed)<span class="vh">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="smcap">J. Sturt</span>.</p></div>

<p class="p1">“I was not much pleased with the contents of this letter,
more especially from an officer who belonged to the force
under my command; and as I had been, for many years,
at the head of the building department in the upper provinces,
and as the more I saw of the site and plan selected
the more objectionable both appeared, I wrote to Captain
Douglas, the Assistant Adjutant-General, whose reply was
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr4">May 11th.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brigadier</span>,</p>

<p>Sir Willoughby saw and approved the plan of the new cantonments;
if, therefore, you have any objection to the progress of
the work, you have only to state them to the Envoy,</p>

<p class="pr6">Yours, very truly,</p>
<p class="pr4">(Signed)<span class="vh">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="smcap">J. Douglas.</span></p></div>

<p class="p1">“I accordingly stated my opinion to the Envoy; and as he
appeared to agree with me, I was in hope that something
would be done, but I was disappointed. By some it was
considered that I was interfering with what did not concern
me; but it was afterwards proved, to a sad degree, how
badly the plan was suited to the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was afterwards anxious to place my men in a fort that
was contiguous to the Balla Hissar, and which had become
the property of the king from the traitorous conduct of the
owner. To this the Envoy consented but afterwards changed
his mind, and I was unable to get anything settled before I
left the force.</p>

<p>“The engineer stated, that he ‘had laid the foundation of
one-half;’ but this was of very little consequence, as the
excavations for them were, in a great measure, filled up with
the fruit trees cut into blocks, that had been cut down to
make room for the barracks.</p>

<p>“It was afterwards found necessary (at a great expense) to
excavate a ditch, to construct a strong wall, a banquet and
parapets, but all were insufficient to keep out the Afghans.</p>

<p>“As the country became in a very unsettled state, and the
town of Caubul full of armed men ripe for mischief, I waited
on the Envoy and told him that I considered the treasure
was very unsafe, as it was then lodged in the house occupied
by Sir Alexander Burnes, and Captain Johnson, the
paymaster of the force that I commanded, and which was
in the heart of the city. At the time there was a very
small force at Caubul. The Envoy agreeing with me, I
ordered the treasure in to the Balla Hissar, where it was
perfectly safe. Being, however, distant from the paymaster’s
quarters, it gave him and his clerks some additional
trouble, and he wrote as follows to the Military Secretary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Lawrence</span>,</p>

<p>Burnes is of opinion I might bring the treasure into the town,
where it was before&mdash;that is to say at my house. This would be a
very great convenience to me, for I am now considerably bothered,
having to send up to the Balla Hissar for coin required. Kindly
mention this to the Envoy, and if possible get it done,</p>

<p class="pr6">Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">H. Johnson</span>.</p>

<p>The guard would also strengthen our position here, two such valuable
people.</p>

<p>
H. J.<br />
</p>

<p class="pi12"><i>Memo by Sir W. H. Macnaghten.</i></p>

<p>Johnson may, of course, put his treasure wherever he deems it
most safe and convenient.</p>

<p class="pr4">W. M.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p class="pi12"><i>From Capt. Johnson to Brigadier Roberts.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brigadier</span>,</p>

<p>Macnaghten has allowed me to have the whole of the treasure
at my house in the town. It amounts to close upon seven lacs.
Will you kindly allow me whatever you may consider a sufficient
guard to come to-morrow. I send for your perusal my note on the
subject, and the Envoy’s reply.</p>

<p class="pr6">Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">H. Johnson</span>.</p></div>

<p class="p1">“This correspondence surprised and annoyed me, situated
as I was; but as I had differed so often with the Envoy
regarding precautionary and other matters, the treasure was
sent to the town. The disposable force at the time was
very small; but a guard, of the strength for which there
was accommodation, was furnished as before; at the same
time I stated that there was great risk, and that the treasure
was removed from the Balla Hissar entirely against the
opinion of Brigade-Major Troup and myself; but I was
considered an alarmist, and my opinion had no weight with
the Envoy, who could not be persuaded that there was any
necessity for precaution.” <i>M. S.</i></p>


<p class="pc1">[<i>Book IV., chapter 4, page 153.</i>]</p>

<p class="pc1"><i>Copy of a Memorandum by the Duke of Wellington, on Sir
W. H. Macnaghten’s Letter of October 26, 1841.</i></p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr4">January 29th, 1842. At night.</p>

<p>It is impossible to read the letter from Mr. Macnaghten
to the Secretary to the Government in India, without being
sensible of the precarious and dangerous position of our
affairs in Central Asia.</p>

<p>Mr. Macnaghten complains of reports against the King,
Shah Soojah Khan, and his government, as libels.</p>

<p>Of these we can know nothing; but I am convinced that
no complaints or libels can be so strong as the facts stated
by Mr. Macnaghten in this letter.</p>

<p>It appears that when Mr. Macnaghten heard of the first
symptoms and first acts of this rebellion, he prevailed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
the King to send a message to the rebels, inviting them to
return to their allegiance.</p>

<p>The selection of the person sent is curious&mdash;Humza Khan,
the Governor of Caubul. His mission failed, of course, says
Mr. Macnaghten, because Humza Khan was the chief instigator
of the rebellion!</p>

<p>We know in this country something of the customs of
those countries&mdash;of the meaning of some of the native expressions
in this letter. It appears that there are four
thanahs, or posts, between Caubul and Gundamuck. A
thanah is either a permanent or a temporary post, to guard
a road or district of importance. We have seen who the
person was, selected to induce the rebels to submit; let us
now see who were the persons appointed to take charge of
those thanahs or posts in the disturbed country&mdash;those
named in the subsequent part of the despatch as the very
men who were the leaders in the rebellion, in the attack, and
destruction, and murder, of the East India Company’s officers
and troops!</p>

<p>No libels can state facts against the Afghan Government
stronger than these.</p>

<p>But Mr. Macnaghten has discovered that the Company’s
troops are not sufficiently active personally, nor are they
sufficiently well armed for the warfare in Afghanistan. Very
possibly an Afghan will run over his native hills faster than
an Englishman or a Hindoo. But we have carried on war
in hill countries, as well in Hindostan and the Deccan as in
the Spanish Peninsula; and I never heard that our troops
were not equal, as well in personal activity as by their arms,
to contend with and overcome any natives of hills whatever.
Mr. Macnaghten ought to have learnt by this time that hill
countries are not conquered, and their inhabitants kept in
subjection, solely by running up the hills and firing at long
distances. The whole of a hill country of which it is necessary
to keep possession, particularly for the communications
of the army, should be occupied by sufficient bodies of
troops, well supplied, and capable of maintaining themselves;
and not only not a Ghilzye or insurgent should be
able to run up and down hills, but not a cat or a goat, except
under the fire of those occupying the hills. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
the mode of carrying on the war, and not by hiring Afghans
with long matchlocks to protect and defend the communications
of the British army.</p>

<p>Shah Soojah Khan may have in his service any troops that
he and Mr. Macnaghten please.</p>

<p>But if the troops in the service of the East India Company
are not able, armed and equipped as they are, to
perform the service required of them in Central Asia, I
protest against their being left in Afghanistan. It will
not do to raise, pay, and discipline matchlock-men, in order
to protect the British troops and their communications,
discovered by Mr. Macnaghten to be no longer able to protect
themselves.</p>

<p class="pc2">CAUSES OF THE KOHISTAN REVOLT.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Book IV., chapter 4, page 157.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">“In the year 1839, on the accession of Shah Soojah, he
granted to the Kohistanee chiefs, who had embraced his
cause and raised the insurrection (which so paralysed the
movements of Dost Mahomed Khan), an increase of wages,
amounting to five hundred tomauns a year, which sum, however,
was not payable in ready money, but by order on the
land-tax of the chief himself, or on that of some turbulent
district where regular payment was doubtful, and the influence
of the chief necessary to secure any payment at all.
The value of the sum thus given, might, therefore, in the
government amount be rated at nothing. I may here mention
that all the pay, as termed, of these chiefs, was of the
same kind; and I am not aware of any instance in which
the amount surpassed that of the land-tax payable by the
chief, or, indeed, equalled it; and, in my opinion, it would
have been better to have released the chiefs altogether then
from the payment of that tax, for the manner of realising
it was one of the greatest grievances, as our power rendered
it unnecessary for the tax-gatherers to show the same consideration
for these nobles which they had formerly been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
obliged to do. Our instructions not to interfere in these
internal affairs, rendered us powerless to afford relief, though
we saw discontent and disloyalty growing around us. During
the year 1840 the chiefs in the different parts of the country
found that the change of government was inimical to their
interests and power, insomuch that it had given them a
master who was able to compel obedience, instead of one
who was obliged to overlook their excesses in exchange for
their support. They therefore gladly revolted to support
the return of Dost Mahomed Khan. No doubt other causes
largely combined to irritate them. Hatred of foreign domination,
fanaticism, the licentiousness of the troops, and
especially the impunity with which women could be seduced
and carried off in a country celebrated for the strictness of
the late ruler on this point, and the extreme jealousy of the
natives. The consequence of this revolt was the despatch
of General Sale’s force to the Kohistan in the autumn of
that year. The force was too weak for the destruction of
the rebels; and Sir A. Burnes, the Political Agent, with
a force, found it necessary to temporise and treat with all
who had not made themselves very remarkable in opposition;
and of those who had, the most extreme step ventured upon
was delivering over the possessions of the rebel to his cousin,
or nearest of kin, who was of the royal party; and Sir A.
Burnes (under the authority of Sir W. H. Macnaghten,
afterwards sanctioned by the Governor-General in Council)
promised to those persons, and the others who had remained
neuter during the contest (joining us at the end), that they
should enjoy the pay and advantages promised on the succession
of Shah Soojah. It was also understood that no
alteration would afterwards be made. These agreements
were made by Prince Timour, who had plenary powers from
his father, and the arrangements were finally approved of
by the Shah himself; and under the feeling that the promises
of the British Government would be sacredly observed,
the discontented who remained untouched sate down and
turned their attention to agriculture.”&mdash;[<i>Major Pottinger’s
Report. MS. Records.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc2">WARNINGS TO SIR ALEXANDER BURNES.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Book V., chapter 1, page 169.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">“Before daylight a well-wisher of Burnes came to report
to him that a plan had been hatched during the night,
which had for its chief object his murder. Unfortunately,
Sir Alexander could not be convinced that the man was
telling the truth, and paid no heed to what he said.
Shortly after, the Wuzeer, Oosman Khan, arrived (by this
time the mob was assembling). The Wuzeer urged him to
leave his house, and proceed to cantonments. Sir Alexander
scorned the idea of quitting his house, as he had
every hope of quelling the disturbance; and let the worst
come to the worst he felt too well assured that neither the
Envoy nor General would permit him to be sacrificed whilst
in the performance of his public duty, so long as there
were 6000 men within two miles of him.”&mdash;[<i>Captain Johnson’s
Journal: MS. Records.</i>] “The King’s minister went
to Burnes early on the morning of the 2nd, and warned
him of what was about to happen&mdash;of the danger of remaining
in his house&mdash;and requested him to accompany him
to the Balla Hissar; but he was deaf to all entreaties,
incredulous, and persevered in disbelief that any outbreak
was intended; yet I am told he wrote into cantonments
for a military force to protect him.”&mdash;[<i>Letters of Brigadier
Shelton: MS. Records.</i>] The native friend said by Captain
Johnson to have warned Burnes early in the morning of the
2nd of November that his life was in danger, was Taj
Mahomed, who, as stated elsewhere in a note, on the authority
of Mohun Lal (and the same story is told by Lieutenant
Eyre and Lady Sale, in their journals), visited Burnes on
the preceding night. Bowh Singh, Burnes’s chuprassie, the
only surviving witness of what passed in that officer’s house
upon the fatal morning, says that his master did not wake
before the arrival of the Wuzeer, and that the man (Wullee
Mahomed by name), who had called to warn Burnes of his
danger, was not admitted, nor was his message ever delivered.
“On the day of the murder,” says this witness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
“as early as three o’clock in the morning, a Cossid (Wullee
Mahomed) came to me. I was on duty outside; he said,
‘Go, and inform your master immediately that there is a
tumult in the city, and that the merchants are removing
their goods and valuables from the shops.’ I knew what
my master had said on the subject the day before, so I did
not like awakening him, but put on my chuprass, and went
to the Char Chouk. Here I met the Wuzeer, Nizam-ood-Dowlah,
going towards my master’s house. I immediately
turned with him, and on my arrival awoke my master, who
dressed quickly, and went to the Wuzeer, and talked to him
some time.” As this man speaks of what he saw, and what
he did on the morning of the 2nd of November, I conceive
that his evidence is the best that is now obtainable. He
states that “Sir Alexander Burnes was duly informed by
his Afghan servants, the day previous to his murder, that
there was a stir in the city, and that if he remained in it
his life would be in danger; they told him he had better
go to the cantonments; this he declined doing, giving as
his reason that the Afghans never received any injury from
him, but, on the contrary, he had done much for them, and
that he was quite sure they would never injure him.”</p>

<p>A statement of a directly contrary tendency has, however,
been made by Lieutenant Mackenzie, late of the 41st Regiment,
who has illustrated the melancholy history of our
Caubul disasters in a poem of twelve cantos. “I am
enabled,” he says, “to state positively, on the authority of
a letter from Sir Alexander Burnes himself (one of the last
he ever wrote, and addressed to an officer of high rank, and
one of his most intimate friends), that poor Burnes had long
foreseen the crisis which had arrived; for, in the letter
alluded to, he states his conviction in the most solemn terms
that he was a marked man and would inevitably be the
first victim;&mdash;but, nevertheless, he would never flinch from
what he conceived to be his duty, although all his warnings
had been disregarded.”</p>

<p class="pc2">INDECISION OF GENERAL ELPHINSTONE.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Book V., chapter 2, p. 187.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">The following is the letter alluded to in the text; written
by General Elphinstone to the Envoy on the 2nd of November:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir William</span>,</p>

<p>Since you left me, I have been considering what can be done
to-morrow. Our dilemma is a difficult one. Shelton, if re-inforced
to-morrow, might, no doubt, force in two columns on his way
towards the Lahore gate, and we might from hence force in that
gate and meet them. But if this were accomplished, what shall we
gain? It can be done, but not without very great loss, as our people
will be exposed to the fire from the houses the whole way. Where
is the point you said they were to fortify near Burnes’s house? If
they could assemble there, that would be a point of attack; but to
march into the town, it seems, we should only have to come back
again; and as to setting the city on fire, I fear, from its construction,
that is almost impossible. We must see what the morning brings,
and then think what can be done. The occupation of all the houses
near the gates might give us a command of the town, but we have
not means of extended operations. If we could depend on the
Kuzzilbashes, we might easily reduce the city.</p>

<p class="pc2">DEATHS OF LIEUTENANT RATTRAY AND CAPTAIN CODRINGTON.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Book V., chapter 4, pages 227-231.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">Some interesting particulars of the deaths of Lieutenant
Rattray and Captain Codrington are given in a narrative of
the events at Charekur, supplied by Major Pottinger’s
Moonshee. It appears that some chiefs had warned the
former officer that if he left the fort he would be killed by
the people outside; but that Rattray had replied, “They
have eaten our salt, and could not be guilty of such an act.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>”
The Moonshee then goes on to say: “When Mr. Rattray
came near them, all the chiefs paid their respects to him,
saying, ‘Inshallah! we shall go to-morrow and fight with
Meer Musjedee.’ Mr. R. said, ‘Very good! If you will go,
I shall give your people presents on their return; and
to-morrow they shall receive five rupees each for their
expenses, and I will also go with my sowars.’ Mr. R. then
turned to go back to the fort; but Jubbar Khan asked him
to look at his men, to which he agreed, and turned back
again. When he had taken about six or seven steps, one
of the Kohistanees called him by name, and ran at him,
firing his gun at Mr. R., who turned and ran towards the
fort. I, the Meerza, and the Chuprassie, all ran towards
the fort. When I had nearly reached it I looked back, and
saw Mr. R. lying down on the plain. I ran again towards
him, and when near him, he called me, and told me to take
hold of him and help him into the fort. Directly I took
hold of his hand about fifty Kohistanees fired, and Mr. R.
received a ball in his forehead. I then ran back and got
into the fort, where I found Major Pottinger looking towards
the Kohistanees, and firing at them.” The touching circumstances
of Captain Codrington’s death are thus related:&mdash;“When
Captain Codrington saw that Major Pottinger was
wounded, he went out to the two companies; but was very
severely wounded by a shot in the back. All his Sepoys
began to cry for him ... Captain Codrington was able
to walk into cantonments; but fell down before he reached
his house, and asked for water. We carried him and laid
him on the same bed as Major Pottinger, whom he asked
for pen, ink, and paper, and wrote a letter to his wife, whose
picture he also gave to Major Pottinger. He lingered on
until the night of the 7th, when he died. We buried him
and Lieutenant Salisbury in one grave.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

<p class="pc2">SECRET WRITING.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Books IV. and V. passim.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">In the letter quoted in the above-named page, the Envoy
alludes to the system of secret writing which has now superseded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
the old plan of correspondence by cypher; and as at
a later period, during General Pollock’s occupation of the
passes between Peshawur and Caubul, it was found of the
utmost service to our officers, it may be interesting to
describe the method in the words of the Envoy: “Are you
in possession of the <i>hikmut</i> of concealed writing, by means
of conjee-water and a solution of iodine? This is much
better than any cypher. The paper is to all appearance
blank, but when rubbed over with the solution, the words
written with conjee-water start into life, as it were, most
miraculously. Something unimportant is generally written
with common ink, and what is intended as secret is interlined
with conjee-water. Try this some day. Any medical
man in your neighbourhood will give the solution. The
paper intended to be used should first have a gentle coat of
the solution passed over it, and suffered to dry.”</p>

<p>In another letter to the same correspondent, the Envoy
again adverts to this mode of cypher writing: “I find it is
not necessary to prepare the paper in the first instance. You
write on ordinary paper, and having spread a solution of
iodine over it, the invisible writing becomes apparent. When
there is any writing of this kind on my paper, I shall put
the day of the month in letters, instead of figures. Perhaps
you would adopt the same sign.”</p>


<p class="pc2">SIR WILLIAM MACNAGHTEN AND THE PRICE OF BLOOD.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Book V., chapter 5, pages 265-267.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1 reduct">[The following passages, containing much authentic evidence relating
to this painful subject, is extracted from the <i>Friend of India</i> (Serampore
newspaper).]</p>

<p class="p1">“To crown the evidence of Sir William Macnaghten’s
never having been implicated in this alleged assassination of
the two chiefs, we have an acknowledgment under Mohun
Lal’s own signature. When he was claiming remuneration
for his services of the Court of Directors, he delivered in the
following document, which has been copied for us from a
paper in his own hand-writing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<table id="t01" summary="t01">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdtoc">Advanced to Abdool Aziz, who offered to kill
Abdoollah Khan, by such means which
the Envoy did not approve, therefore the
balance 11,000 rupees was not paid.</td>
  <td class="tdcl">Rs. <br />4,000</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">“Thus it appears that while Mohun Lal told the Reviewer
that Sir William objected to pay the balance, because
he had not seen the heads; he told the Court of Directors
that the balance was not paid because the Envoy did not
approve of the means that had been used!” <span class="ls1">* * * *</span></p>

<p>Major Colin Troup writes thus in a letter now before us:</p>

<p>“Akbar Khan never would allow Macnaghten’s name to
be mentioned before him but in terms of the greatest
respect; and has in private, both to poor Pottinger and
myself, over and over again regretted the deed, and stated
that it never was premeditated; so far the contrary, that,
having been accused by Ameen-oollah’s party of being
friendly to, and intriguing with the English, to disarm suspicion,
he in open Durbar volunteered, if he was allowed
time, to bring Macnaghten a prisoner into Ameen-oollah’s
house within eight days. This being agreed to, it was then
that he planned the treacherous conference with Sir William;
but, finding, after some delay, that he was not likely to
accomplish his object, and fearing to meet his party if he
failed in his boasted adventure, and hearing a cry that our
troops were marching out of the cantonments to where he
and Sir William were sitting, he, in a moment of desperation,
out with his pistol and shot Sir William; but he
always loudly declared that on the morning of the conference,
when he came out to meet Sir William, he never
for one moment contemplated doing him any harm whatever.
I have all this written down, and can, if necessary, take
my oath to what I have written, as coming from the mouth
of Akbar Khan himself, and you are most welcome to make
what use of it you please, in defence of the character of one
of the brightest ornaments our country ever did, or ever
will produce.” ... We have the most abundant
evidence that Sir William Macnaghten’s character for integrity
and good faith always stood equally high among the
Afghans; and that when their chiefs were triumphant, and
bitterly reproached the British prisoners for the wrongs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
their nation had inflicted on Afghanistan, the charge of
encouraging assassination was never whispered for a moment.
Lieutenant-Colonel Lawrence states: “During our lengthened
imprisonment, I unhesitatingly affirm that not one of
the prisoners ever heard Mahomed Akbar, or any of the
chiefs, accuse Sir William of bribing men to assassinate
them; and it is not likely they would have been silent, if
they had so heavy a charge to bring forward. On the contrary,
I, as well as others, have heard both Mahomed Akbar
Khan and other chiefs express deep regret at the Envoy’s
untimely death, and much admiration of his character.
Ameen-oollah Khan, when I was his prisoner, told me that
Sir W. H. Macnaghten had offered a lakh of rupees for his
head. Prisoner though I was, I denounced it in open
Durbar as an infamous lie, and never heard any more about
it.” Captain Colin Mackenzie writes: “If Sir William had
ever instructed Mohun Lal or any other person to employ
assassins for the removal of our treacherous and inveterate
enemies, it would have been well known to the Afghans themselves,
and they would not have failed to urge so plausible a
ground of complaint against us, while we were captives in
their hands, which they never did, although they constantly
reproached us with every act of supposed injustice on the
part of government, and with the private vices and improprieties
of individuals.” Captain W. Anderson, another of
the prisoners, writes: “I never heard any Afghan accuse
Sir W. H. Macnaghten of any acts for which any friend of
his, or any Englishman, need feel ashamed. On the contrary,
I always heard him spoken of with great respect, and
frequently with admiration.” Captain Warburton states:
“I went into Caubul to the Newab’s on the 28th, I think,
of December, 1841. I remained in his house till we were
forced out of it on the 12th of April following. During
that time no one was prevented seeing us. Our party consisted
of J. Conolly, Airey, Walsh, Webb, Drummond, and
myself (besides Haughton and Campbell, who joined us afterwards).
We had an opportunity of seeing and conversing
with most of the chiefs at Caubul, who remained after Akbar
Khan had left. None of these people ever concealed their
opinions regarding the acts of our government or people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
Ameen-oollah Khan, in particular, spoke at times very
strongly, but neither from him, nor from any other, during
the period of my residence, did I ever hear a word regarding
the charge now brought forward against Sir William of
having offered money for the assassination of the chiefs. I
had sufficient opportunities of hearing something about the
matter, if any such offer had been made.”</p>

<p class="pc2">THE QUESTION OF CAPITULATION.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Book V., chapter 5, pages 270-272.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">The following are the letters referred to in the text,
which passed between the Envoy and the General, from the
5th to the 8th of December:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr4">5th December.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir William</span>,</p>

<p>It becomes my duty to inform you that our stock of provisions
is reduced to nine days, on half-rations; it therefore becomes
imperative upon us to consider what can be done. We have, for
the last few days, been disappointed in our expectation of getting
any, and our hopes of success in doing this seem every day less.
The objections to retreat on the Balla Hissar I have already stated;
our wants there might be the same, with the additional one of fuel,
and part of our ordnance for protection. Retreat without terms I
think with you almost impossible, and that few would reach Jellalabad.
The only alternative (as there now seems little chance of
the Ghilzyes renewing the negotiation you were led to expect), is
to try if terms can be made in any other quarter, if we do not hear
something favourable to-morrow. With provisions we could hold
out, but without them I do not see what can be done, or how we
are to avert starvation. It is true the responsibility is great, and
may fall on us; but are we justified in risking the safety of so many
people when we can no longer do anything? When reduced to the
last extremity (where we now are almost), I think honourable terms
better for our government than our being destroyed here, which,
without food, is inevitable. All this I write in confidence for your
own consideration, that you may think what is best to be done, as
I have told our real situation.</p>

<p class="pr6">Yours, truly,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr4 p1">December 5.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear General</span>,</p>

<p>I have received your note of this morning. I am perfectly
aware of the state of our supplies; but as we have nine days’ provision,
and had only provisions for one or two days when the siege
commenced, I conceive that we are better off now than we were a
month ago. Whenever we go, we could not carry with us more
than two or three days’ supplies, and, therefore, it does not seem
necessary to come to an immediate decision. But I will speak to
you on the subject to-morrow, and will omit no favourable opportunity
of negotiating.</p>

<p class="pr4">W. H. M.</p>

<p class="pr4 p1">
(Private.)<span class="vh">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>Cantonments, 6th Dec., 1841.</p>

<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">My dear General</span>,</p>

<p>I now proceed to give you my opinion on your note of yesterday.
There are three courses which may be said to be open to us.
First, a retreat on Jellalabad, without terms. Secondly, a retreat
to India, with terms, abandoning our position in this country.
And, thirdly, to retire into the Balla Hissar. The first I regard as
impracticable; and, if practicable, the adoption of such a measure
would cover us with everlasting infamy, as we could not take the
King’s family along with us, and his Majesty would not stir without
them. The second I regard as nearly equally impracticable, from
the conflicting interests of the parties with whom we should have
to treat. This cause would, I think, render any promised protection
ineffectual, and, if this course could be safely adopted, the
consequences would be terrific as regards the safety of our Indian
Empire and our interests in Europe. The third course seems to
me (though certainly attended with risk) to be by far the most safe
and honourable which we could adopt. With four or five disposable
regiments in the Balla Hissar, it would be strange if we could not
obtain fuel and provisions; we should be in a position to overawe
the city, and to encourage the Kuzzilbashes and our other well-wishers
to come forward to our support; and we should probably
find in the Balla Hissar provisions for a fortnight or a month. I
would, therefore, lose no time in sending every night, by all possible
contrivances, our stores, and sick, and wounded. Should the report
of the advance of troops from Candahar prove correct (which we
shall, in all probability, hear to-morrow), all our troubles will cease.
Should we have reason to believe it unfounded, we can then commence
destroying our powder and superfluous stores. In the mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
time, I think we have daily proofs that the forces of our enemies
are diminishing; and, with the blessing of Providence, some event
may arise from their misunderstandings to relieve us from our present
perilous position, even without the accession of fresh troops.</p>

<p class="pr6">Very sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="pr4">W. H. M.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">My dear Sir William</span>,</p>

<p>Since your departure, I have thought over, and given my
utmost attention to, every part of the subject of our conversation.
The first proposition was a night expedition against the Deh-Hadjee,
said to be distant about three coss, part of the road through a
narrow gorge, through which I now hear guns could not go; and I
am also told that parties (of cavalry) have, for the last five or six
days, been seen going in that direction: no doubt for the object of
preventing our getting supplies. If we succeed in taking the fort
(if only one), we must hold it (to enable us to remove any quantity
of grain with our means) for some time; during which, the enemy,
hearing of our attack, would, no doubt, come out against our detachment;
and from Captain Johnson’s account, it is difficult to find
grain. Another difficulty is our want of local knowledge (this may,
perhaps, be obtained). These are the objections that present themselves
to this plan.</p>

<p>With respect to a like enterprise on Killa Bolundee, that appears,
I confess (and I would willingly grasp at anything to enable us to
hold out), to be more difficult, from the facility with which a party
might be cut off by a sortie from the city. The other alternative is
the Balla Hissar; from thence seems the only chance we have of
getting supplies; and as you now think our being able to make any
terms is impossible, that seems the only one left. Colonel Chambers
has been with me, and says his horses would be quite unequal to a
forced march to Jellalabad, and that many of those of Anderson’s
regiment are unserviceable from want of food. Captain Anderson
reported, this morning, one-half.</p>

<p>After leaving cantonments, terms, I should suppose, are quite out
of the question; our quitting would be, I presume, considered as
our total defeat; and, until re-inforced, as we must sacrifice nearly
all our cattle, we would not have the power of moving, for, without
the means of transport, we would not go.</p>

<p>The next consideration is, whether our being annihilated here,
or entering into honourable terms, would have the worst effect for
our government. The responsibility is great for you and I; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
(if we do not hear of the force from Candahar to-morrow) it only
remains for us to consider whether we shall incur the responsibility,
or risk the loss of this force; for, under the most favourable view
we can take, the risk is great. Looking practically at the obstacles
we have, they are in reality very difficult to surmount.</p>

<p>I submit all this for your consideration, and have sent Major
Thain with this to you.</p>

<p class="pr4">Yours, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="pr4">W. K. E.</p>

<p class="p1">We must not think of treating, after any attempt either to retreat,
or go to the Balla Hissar, or if we fail in any attempt. We are now
comparatively entire; a loss or failure would increase our destitution,
and the terms will, of course, be worse. We could not expect
anything else.</p>

<p class="pr4 p1">Dec. 8, 1841.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir William</span>,</p>

<p>The commissary has just reported to me, that on examination
of the grain he has in store, he finds from the quantity of dirt mixed
with it, he has not above four days’ supplies left, at most. Under
these circumstances, it becomes absolutely necessary for us to come
to a decision as to our future measures, as I do not see how we are
to hold out, without food for our Sepoys, beyond that time.</p>

<p class="pr4">W. K. E.</p></div>


<p class="pc2">THE SURRENDER OF THE FORTS.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Book VI., chapter I., page 291.</i>]</p>

in the text:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr4">Dec. 16, 1841.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir William</span>,</p>

<p>I wish you would write me an official letter, with your
opinion as to the necessity of giving up the forts, in furtherance of
your negotiations. I think, if absolutely necessary, it must be done.
Our situation cannot be made worse, but I think they ought to take
them one at a time, beginning with Zoolfikar’s (the grain fort) and
the Ricka-Bashee, they sending us supplies. This will be a mutual
proof of confidence: the abandoning of these forts if they are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
sincere, giving up these cantonments and the possibility of retreat
from them. Of <i>course</i> the hostages will be sent, as you think they
ought to be: pray name them in your letter, if they have offered,
or you proposed any.</p>

<p>I herewith return the two letters from Trevor and Captain
Drummond.</p>

<p class="pr6">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="pr4">W. K. E.</p></div>

<p class="p1">The magazine fort is, in fact, part of our cantonments, and ought

to us.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr4">December 16, 1841.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acquaint you that I have received a
proposition from Mahomed Oosman Khan and Ameen-oollah Khan,
to the effect that we should give up to them certain forts in the
vicinity of the cantonments, with a view to convince the population
of the sincerity of our intention to leave the country; by which
arrangement also they stated that they would be able to supply us
punctually with provisions.</p>

<p>I am aware of the objections to such an arrangement in a military
point of view; but as I am of opinion that the proposition has
emanated from a suspicion of our intentions, rather than from any
sinister motive on the part of the Afghan chiefs, I would strongly
recommend that the proposition be complied with. We are clearly
completely in the power of our new allies as regards the article of
provisions; and it is not clear to me what other course than compliance
is open to us. By this course we show confidence, and have
at least the chance of making a safe and honourable retreat out of
the country: whereas, by refusal, we may exasperate those with
whom we are treating, and be utterly cut off from the means of
subsistence.</p>

<p>Since the above was written, I have received an intimation that
no further supplies will be sent us, until the proposition of the
chiefs be complied with; and I request that you will inform me
whether you are prepared to give up the forts</p>

<p>The chiefs have promised that thirty men, who shall be under
control, are to occupy each of the places to be delivered up; and
I hope that the brother of Newab Mahomed Zemaun Khan will
reside in the cantonment as a hostage until our departure.</p>

<p class="pc2">SUPPLIES FROM THE AFGHANS.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Book VI., chapter I., pages 291, 292.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">Captain Johnson’s journal furnishes the best information
extant relative to the measures taken throughout the siege,
and after the capitulation, to supply the force with provisions.
Under dates <i>Dec. 12th</i> and <i>13th</i>, he writes: “A
few provisions sent into cantonments by the Sirdars. A
lakh of rupees advanced to Mahomed Akbar for the purchase
of camels&mdash;not one as yet forthcoming. The Seeah-Sungh
gateway, through which all supplies come in, is daily
infested by parties of Afghans, calling themselves <i>Ghazees</i>,
or fighters for religion. They are, without exception, the
most barefaced, impertinent scoundrels under the sun.
Armed with swords, daggers, and matchlocks, they acknowledge
no chief, but act independently&mdash;they taunt and insult
the whole of us. Not a Sepoy can venture twelve paces
from the bridge over the ditch without being plundered of
what he has. People from the town, bringing in grain or
<i>boosah</i> (bran), are often plundered and beaten. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
our cattle and men are starving, no measures are taken by
our military authorites to check all this. It is true, our
ramparts are lined with our soldiers, and plenty of cannon
at each bastion, and a six-pounder at the bridge loaded with
grape&mdash;but to what purpose? Our men are told, on no
account to fire upon the Afghans, without the most urgent
necessity, for fear of putting a stop to the good feeling
existing on their part. The chiefs have been applied to, to
use their influence to prevent these people assembling near
our cantonments. Their reply is, ‘We cannot do so&mdash;they
are not under our controul; but if they misbehave themselves,
fire upon them.’ To-day, I was at the Seeah-Sungh
gateway, anxiously looking out for some food for my public
cattle. About thirty loads of <i>boosah</i> came to within six
paces of the bridge, and where the guard was standing. The
officer on duty, as also the field officer of the week, was
there. The wretched rabble above alluded to, stopped the
drivers of the donkeys and abused them, beat them and
ordered them back, and threatened them with more ill-usage
in the event of their returning to sell any article to the
Feringhees. This was reported by me to the General, and
there it ended.”</p>

<p>And again, on the 15th, the active commissariat officer
writes: “A few supplies sent into cantonments, and people
still bringing in private speculations; but are subjected to
the same ill-treatment as noticed on the 12th and 13th.
Attah and barley sell from 1½ to 3 and 4 seers the rupee
(from 3lb. to 6lb. and 8lb. for 2<i>s.</i>) ... To-day a flock of
sheep belonging to cantonments was grazing outside of the
walls, under the care of the shepherd. Two men attacked
him close under where our sentries, with loaded muskets,
were standing. The shepherd fled, and so did the two men
with the whole flock of sheep, and drove them along the
whole face of cantonment. Report made to the General,
whose reply was, ‘They had no business to go outside;’
and all this time our garrison starving!”&mdash;[<i>Captain

<p class="pc2">CIRCUMSTANCES PRECEDING THE DEATH OF THE ENVOY.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Book VI., chapter I., pages 299, 300.</i>]</p>

<p class="pc1"><i>Statement of Captain Mackenzie.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“The proposition which induced the Envoy (in opposition
to his theretofore avowed principle and practice in refusing
to meet Mahomed Akbar or any of the other Khans, save
in a body) to grant the fatal interview to the Sirdar and
his more immediate confederates, had emanated from the
murderer himself, and had been conveyed to the Envoy the
night previously by Mahomed Sadig Khan, half brother of
Akbar, by Surwar Khan Lohanee, who came into the cantonment
in company with the late Captain Skinner, then
released for the first time from the custody in which he had
been retained, first by Ameen-oollah Khan, and latterly by
Mahomed Akbar himself.</p>

<p>“The Sirdar had acquainted Captain Skinner with the
nature of his pretended wishes, as if in friendly conference,
requesting him to act the part of chief ambassador, Captain
Skinner’s disapproval of which in all probability saved his
life for the time being; but he, Captain Skinner, was the
only officer present during the eventful conference of the
evening of the 22nd, and from him I subsequently derived
the information, which I now give, of the nature of Mahomed
Akbar’s message. It was to this effect,&mdash;that he and
his particular friends (to wit, the Ghilzyes) should either
come over in a body into the cantonment, placing themselves
under the orders of the Envoy, or that, at a preconcerted
signal, without giving warning to the other confederates, in
concert with a body of British troops, take possession of the
fort of Mahmood Khan; then seizing the person of Ameen-oollah
Lohganee, whom for a pecuniary reward they proposed
to murder; that the Sirdar should acknowledge Shah
Soojah for his sovereign, his reward being the payment&mdash;a
present bonus from the British Government&mdash;of thirty
lakhs of rupees, and a stipend of four lakhs of rupees per
annum for life; that the British troops should be allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
to remain unmolested, as if with the perfect concurrence
and by the express wish of the so-formed Afghan Government,
for a period of six months, at which time they were
to evacuate the country as if by their own free will, thus
carrying with them an untarnished reputation (the expression
was ‘saving their <i>Purdah</i>’), and thus securing a favourable
opportunity for the British home Government to negotiate
a treaty to the security of our Indian frontier with
the cabinet of St. Petersburgh. Up to that date, viz.,
22nd of December, Sir Wm. Macnaghten had, in spite of
his conscientious fulfilment of his verbal engagements with
the assembled Khawaneen (for no written treaty had theretofore
been exchanged), been worn out by their utter falsehood
and bad faith, their original demands having risen to
a pitch of insolence and unreasonableness which amounted
to open mockery&mdash;their conduct had, in fact, virtually
released him from any obligation to adhere to any of his
original propositions; and in despair, as a drowning man
catches at straws, the troops having long before proved themselves
utterly inadequate to his support, or in fact to their
own protection, with immediate ruin and disgrace to himself
and his country staring him in the face, he was in an evil
moment induced to assent to the above proposals, with the
exception of the <i>murder</i> of Ameen-oollah, from which (Captain
S. assured me) he shrank with abhorrence and disgust,
assuring the ambassadors that as a British functionary nothing
would induce him to pay a price for blood. So far
as it may be said that the late Envoy allowed himself to be
duped by a man of the notoriously bad character of Mahomed
Akbar Khan in all matters of good faith, even among
his treacherous countrymen, I can only say that it is not
only my firm belief, but that also of Captain Lawrence, and
others who best knew Sir William, that two months of
incessant fatigue of mind and body, and the load of care
which had during that time weighed him down, had at last
completely unhinged his strong mind. Contrary to his usual
practice, he consulted none of those who had all along possessed
his perfect confidence; his manner was flurried and
agitated; and when, previous to leaving the cantonment on
the morning of the 23rd, I, having for the first time learnt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
his intentions, declared my conviction ‘that it was a trap,’
he abruptly answered, ‘Leave me to manage that: trust
me for that.’ He also observed, I believe, to Captains
Trevor and Lawrence, while riding forth to the scene of his
murder, ‘Death is preferable to the life we are leading
now.’”&mdash;[<i>Answer to Interrogatories put by Gen. Pollock. MS.

<p class="pc1"><i>Mohun Lal’s Statement.</i></p>

<p class="p1">Mohun Lal’s story, as given in a letter to Mr. Colvin, is
worth quoting, though its meaning is somewhat obscured
by its dubious phraseology:&mdash;“Mahomed Akbar, being
afraid of the union to the Douranees with the Shah, induced
Surwar Khan and others, by the hope of reward, to deceive
the Envoy, by saying that he will either spread dissension in
the city to allow us to remain in the country, see us safely
pass down to Jellalabad, or act as the Envoy tells him, on
the condition that Mahomed Akbar was to receive four
lakhs of rupees annually, besides the reward of thirty lakhs
from the British Government, and made the Vizier of the
Suddozye King from generation to generation. As soon as
I heard this by the Persian chief, I wrote to the Envoy
that Mahomed Akbar was deceiving us, and he should place
no faith in anything he says. I also particularly informed
him that he may give money to anybody he likes, to espouse
the cause of the Shah and us, but never to the chiefs, as it
will not induce them to do us service like the others, but will
incite and prepare them against us. Unfortunately he
was assured by Surwar Khan, Naib Ameer, &amp;c., of their
favourable service, and to advance lakhs of rupees. He was
also prompted by these individuals to give the paper of the
above-mentioned agreement to Mahomed Akbar. He showed
it, and said falsely to Ameen-oollah that the Envoy has promised
the money it contains, if Mahomed Akbar were to kill,
catch, or send him alive to the Envoy. Ameen-oollah threw
himself at his feet, and said he is doing all this against us merely
for the good of his father, and he (Akbar) has sense to know
it perfectly; therefore he should not lose time either to
catch or murder the Envoy, which will procure him all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
power and money he wishes. I wrote all this to the Envoy
on the very morning of his murder, begged him to take
very great care of himself, and do not go so often to meet
Mahomed Akbar out of the cantonment, as he is the man
that nobody can trust his word upon oath. I also added
that the Douranees, as well as Ameen-oollah (the instigation
of Akbar), being jealous of the return of his father, have
taken the part of the Shah, and will, in the course of two
days, wait upon his Majesty, ask us to remain here in the
hope of receiving the money promised them by me.”&mdash;[<i>MS.

<p class="pc1">SIR WILLIAM MACNAUGHTEN’S REPORT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF THE CAUBUL OUTBREAK.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">[Found unfinished in the Envoy’s desk after his death.]</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Book V. and Book VI., chapter I.</i>]</p>

<p class="pi4 p1"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>1. It is with feelings of the deepest concern that I
acquaint you, for the information of the Right Honourable
the Governor-General in Council, of my having been compelled
to consent to the abandonment of our position in this
country.</p>

<p>2. The Major-General commanding in Afghanistan will
doubtless detail the military disasters which have led to this
direful necessity; and I shall have occasion, therefore, to
touch upon them but briefly in the course of this narrative.</p>

<p>3. On the morning of the 2nd ult., I was informed that
the town of Caubul was in a state of commotion, and shortly
afterwards I received a note from Lieutenant-Colonel Sir A.
Burnes, to the effect that his house was besieged, and begging
for assistance. I immediately went to General Elphinstone,
and suggested that Brigadier Shelton’s force should
proceed to the Balla Hissar, thence to operate as might seem
expedient; that the remaining troops should be concentrated,
the cantonment placed in a state of defence, and
assistance; if possible, sent to Sir A. Burnes.</p>

<p>4. Before Brigadier Shelton could reach the Balla Hissar,
the town had attained such a state of ferment that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
deemed impracticable to penetrate to Sir A. Burnes’s residence,
which was in the centre of the city. I also sent
messages of assurance to his Majesty by my assistant (Captain
Lawrence), but so great had become the excitement,
that, by noon, the road between the cantonment and the
city was hardly passable.</p>

<p>5. His Majesty, on first hearing of the insurrection, had
sent out his son, Futteh Jung, and the Minister, with
some of the household troops, to repress it; but this party
was speedily repulsed with great slaughter, and in the
meantime I grieve to state that Sir Alexander Burnes,
his brother, Lieutenant C. Burnes, and Captain W. Broadfoot,
had fallen victims to the fury of the mob.</p>

<p>6. From that time affairs grew generally worse. The
enemy showed great judgment in their work of annoying us.
They seized the strongest positions between the cantonment
and the city, and, what was worse than all, they seized the
fort which contained all our stores and provisions. This
step was well-nigh effecting our immediate destruction, and
it is chiefly to it that I attribute our final discomfiture.
We had only four or five days’ supplies for the cantonment.
The Balla Hissar, as well as the cantonment, was in a state
of siege. We could not hope for provisions from thence,
nor would the place have afforded us either food or shelter,
and, in the opinion of the military authorities, to return
thither would have been attended with ruin. A disastrous
retreat seemed the only alternative, but this necessity was
averted by the attack, on the 10th ult., of a neighbouring
fort, which had intermediately furnished us with a scanty
supply of provisions, but which subsequently espoused the
cause of the rebels. The place was carried after a desperate
resistance. We lost in the operation no less than sixty men
killed and wounded of her Majesty’s 44th Regiment alone,
but our immediate wants were supplied by the provisions
found in the fort. I lament to add, that Colonel Mackrell,
Captain M’Crae, and Captain Westmacott, fell on the
occasion.</p>

<p>7. On the 6th ult. I received a hurried note from Major
Pottinger, to the effect that he was closely besieged at
Charekar, and unable to hold out for want of water. Major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
Pottinger himself, with Lieutenant Haughton, came into
cantonments a day or two afterwards, having left the 4th
Regiment in a disorganised state in the neighbourhood of
Istaleff; but, melancholy to relate, that no authentic tidings
of them have up to this day been received. There is every
reason to believe that the entire corps (officers and men)
have been annihilated. Captains Codrington and Rattray
and Lieutenant Salisbury were killed before Major Pottinger
left Charekar, and both he and Lieutenant Haughton were
severely wounded.</p>

<p>8. I had written to Candahar and to Gundamuck for
assistance immediately on the occurrence of the outbreak,
but General Sale’s brigade had proceeded to Jellalabad,
the whole country between this and that place being in a
state of insurrection, and a return to Caubul being deemed
impracticable. From Candahar, though I sent Cossids with
pressing requisitions for assistance almost every day, I could
gain no intelligence, the road being entirely occupied by the
troops and emissaries of the rebels. We learnt from native
reports that Ghuznee was invested by the enemy, and that
Captain Woodburn, who was on his way to Caubul from
Candahar, had been massacred, with a party of leave-of-absence
men by whom he was accompanied, in a small fort
on this side of Ghuznee.</p>

<p>9. We continued, up to the commencement of the present
month, to derive a scanty supply, at great pecuniary
sacrifices, from the neighbouring villages, but about that
time the enemy’s plans had become so well organised, that
our supplies from this source were cut off. The rebels daily
made their appearance in great force in the neighbourhood
of the cantonment, and I lament to add that their operations
were generally attended with success. The details
will be communicated by the military authorities. In the
midst of their successes Mahomed Akbar Khan arrived from
Toorkistan, an event which gave new life to the efforts of
the rebels.</p>

<p>10. In the meantime I had received so many distressful
accounts from the General commanding of the state of
our troops and cattle from want of provisions, and I had
been so repeatedly apprised by him (for reasons which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
will himself doubtless explain) of the hopelessness of further
resistance, that on the 24th ultimo, I deemed it my duty to
address an official letter to him, a copy of which accompanies,
as Appendix A.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>The General’s reply was dated the same day; a copy
accompanies, as Appendix B.</p>

<p>At my invitation, deputies were sent from the rebels, who
came into cantonment on the 25th ultimo, I having in the
meantime received overtures from them of a pacific nature,
on the basis of our evacuating the country. I proposed to
them the only terms which, in my opinion, could be accepted
with honour; but the temper of the rebels may best be
understood when I mention that they returned me a letter
of defiance the next morning, to the effect that, unless I
consented to surrender our arms, and to abandon his
Majesty to his fate, we must prepare for immediate hostilities.
To this I replied, that we preferred death to dishonour,
and that it would remain with a higher Power to decide
between us.</p>

<p>11. Affairs had attained so desperate a state on the 8th
instant, that I again addressed the General a letter, copy of
which accompanies, as Appendix C., and a copy of the
General’s reply of the same date, signed by three of his principal
officers, accompanies as Appendix D. On the next day
I received another letter from the General, copy of which is
sent as Appendix E.</p>

<p>12. I had subsequently a lengthened correspondence with
Mahomed Oosman Khan, Barukzye, the most moderate and
sensible man of the insurgents, and as on the 11th instant
we had not one day’s provisions left, I held a conference
with the whole of the rebel chiefs. The day previous I had
learnt from a letter from Colonel Palmer, at Ghuznee, that
there was no hope of reinforcements from Candahar. I
had repeatedly kept his Majesty informed of the desperate
state of our affairs, and of the probability that we should be
compelled to enter into some accommodation with the enemy.
13. The conference with the rebels took place about a
mile from cantonments. I was attended by Captains Lawrence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
Trevor, and Mackenzie, and there were present on
the part of the rebels the heads nearly of all the chief
tribes in the country. I had committed to paper certain
propositions, to which I had reason to believe they would
have no objection, and I read it to the meeting. A copy
accompanies as Appendix F.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> When I came to the second
article, Mahomed Akbar interrupted me, and observed that
we did not require supplies, as there was no impediment to
our marching the next morning. I mention the above fact
to show the impetuous disposition of this youth. He was
reproved by the other chiefs, and he himself, except on this
one occasion, behaved with courtesy, though evidently
elevated by his sudden change of fortune.</p>

<p>14. The next day I was waited upon by a deputation
from the chiefs, with a proposition that Shah Soojah-ool-Moolk
should be left nominally as king&mdash;the Barukzye exercising
the functions of minister; but this proposition, owing
to the mutual jealousies of the parties concerned, as will
appear in the sequel, fell to the ground.</p>

<p>15. From the foregoing review of occurrences, I trust it
will be evident that I had no recourse left but that of
negotiation; and I had ascertained beyond a doubt that the
rebel chiefs were perfectly aware of our helpless situation,
and that no terms short of our quitting Afghanistan would
satisfy them.</p>

<p>16. The whole country, as far as we could learn, had
risen in rebellion; our communications on all sides were cut
off; almost every public officer, whether paid by ourselves
or his Majesty, had declared for the new governor, and by
far the greater number even of his Majesty’s domestic servants
had deserted him. We had been fighting for forty
days against very superior numbers, under most disadvantageous
circumstances, with a deplorable loss of valuable
lives, and in a day or two we must have perished from
hunger, to say nothing of the advanced season of the year,
and the extreme cold, from the effects of which our native
troops were suffering severely. I had been repeatedly
apprised by the military authorities that nothing could be
done with our troops; and I regret to add that desertions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
to the enemy were becoming of frequent occurrence amongst
our troops. The terms I secured were the best obtainable,
and the destruction of fifteen thousand human beings would
little have benefited our country, whilst our government would
have been almost compelled to avenge our fate, at whatever
cost. We shall part with the Afghans as friends, and I feel
satisfied that any government which may be established
hereafter, will always be disposed to cultivate a good understanding
with us.</p>

<p>17. A retreat without terms would have been impracticable.
It is true that, by entering into terms, we are
prevented from undertaking the conquest of the entire
country, a measure which, from my knowledge of the views
of government, I feel convinced would never be resorted to,
even were the means at hand. But such a project in the
present state of our Indian finances, and the requisitions
for troops in various quarters, I knew could not be entertained.
If the expense already incurred in such a case
would have been intolerable<span class="ls1">...</span>[<i>Sentence imperfect.</i>]</p>

<p>18. I would beg leave to refer to the whole tenor of my
former correspondence for the causes which have produced
this insurrection. Independently of the genius of the
people, which is prone to rebellion, we, as conquerors and
foreigners, of a different creed, were viewed with particular
disfavour by the chiefs, whilst the acts of some of us were
particularly calculated to excite the general jealousy of a
sensitive nation. The haughty demeanour of his Majesty
was not agreeable to the nobles, and, above all, the measures
of economy, to which it was found necessary to resort, were
particularly galling.</p>

<p>Throughout this rebellion I was in constant communication
with the Shah, through my assistant, Lieutenant J.
B. Conolly, who was in attendance on his Majesty in the
Balla Hissar. On the 18th inst. it was agreed upon that
our troops should evacuate the Balla Hissar, and return to
the cantonments, while the Barukzyes should have a conference
with his Majesty with a view to his retaining the
nominal powers of sovereignty, they for their own security
placing a guard of their own in the upper citadel. No
sooner, however, had our troops left the Balla Hissar, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
his Majesty, owing to some panic or misunderstanding,
ordered the gate to be shut, and the proposed conference
was thereby prevented. So offended were the Barukzyes,
that they determined never to offer his Majesty the same
terms again. In explanation of his conduct, his Majesty
states that the party whom the Barukzyes desired to introduce
was not that party which had been agreed upon.</p>

property, take it away, and we shall be convicted of falsehood.</p>

<p>[<i>Remark.</i> Let them pay the hire of the yaboos and
camels.]</p>

<p><i>Article 2.</i> “With reference to the remark that was made
that we should give up all our guns but six, we have with
the force one and a-half companies of artillerymen. You
have fixed six guns. Half of a company would remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
without equipments. Be good enough to give three more
small guns, such as are drawn by mules, for the other half-company.
It will be a great kindness.”</p>

<p>[<i>Remark.</i> They cannot be given.]</p>

<p><i>Article 3.</i> “The muskets in excess of those in use with
the regiments must be left behind.”</p>

<p>This is agreed to. Whatever muskets are in addition to
those in use with the regiments, together with shot and
powder and other ordnance stores, all by way of friendship
shall be the property of the Newab.</p>

<p><i>Article 4.</i> “General Sale, together with his wife and
daughter, and the other gentlemen of rank who are married
and have children, until the arrival of the Ameer Dost
Mahomed Khan and the other Afghans and their families,
and Douranees and Ghilzyes, from Hindostan, shall remain
as guests with us; that when the Ameer Dost Mahomed
Khan shall have arrived, they also shall be allowed to depart
with honour from Afghanistan.”</p>

<p>General Sale is with the army in Jellalabad, the departure
of which is fixed to take place previous to our arrival; and
as for the other two or three gentlemen who are married
and present here, we have sent a man to them. They,
having seen their families, report that their families will not
consent to this proposal; (adding) that you men may do as
you like&mdash;no one can order us. This proposal is contrary
to all order. We now beg you to be good enough to excuse
the women from this suffering, and we agree to give as many
gentlemen as you may wish for. In friendship, kindness
and consideration are necessary, not overpowering the weak
with sufferings. Since, for a long time past, we have
shown kindness and respect to all Afghans of rank and consequence
with whom we have had dealings, you should
consider what we have done for them, and not forget kindness.
As Shah Soojah was father of a family, and the
Ameer Dost Mahomed Khan was with his family, and no
one gave them annoyance, and we showed them respect,
you also now show similar kindness, that friendship may be
increased.</p>

<p class="p1 reduct">[The following is a draft of the new treaty submitted by
the Afghan chiefs, containing the additional articles, and embodying
the matter in Akbar Khan’s “Remarks.”]</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Agreement of Peace that has been determined on with the
Frank English gentlemen, to which engagement, if they
consent and act accordingly, on the part of the heads and
leaders of Afghanistan henceforward no infractions will
occur to their friendly engagements.</i></p>

<p class="p1">1st. That the going of the gentlemen shall be speedy. In
regard to the carriage-cattle, let them send money that they
may be purchased and sent.</p>

<p>2nd. As regards the going of the Sirdars with the
English army that no person may injure it on the way,
Sirdar Mahomed Akbar Khan or Sirdar Mahomed Oosman
Khan, whichever may be wished by the English, will be
appointed and sent.</p>

<p>3rd. The army of Jellalabad shall march previous to the
army of Caubul, and proceed to Peshawur. Sirdar Abdool
Suffoor Khan having been appointed, will leave this and
proceed, that he may previously accompany them; secondly,
the road of Bhungush has been appointed.</p>

<p>4th. The Ghuznee force having got quickly ready will
proceed by the road of Caubul to Peshawur. A relative
of Naib Ameen-oollah Khan, with Mehtur Moosa Khan, has
been appointed to accompany it.</p>

<p>5th. The army of Candahar and other parts of Afghanistan,
wherever an army may be, will quickly depart for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
India. Newab Abdool Jubbar Khan has been appointed to
carry this into effect.</p>

<p>6th. Whatever property of the Ameer may be with the
English will be returned, and nothing retained.</p>

<p>7th. Whatever property of the English may be left for
want of carriage will become the property of the Newab.</p>

<p>8th. If the family of Shah Soojah, on account of want of
carriage, may remain here, they will be placed in the house
of Hadjee Khan.</p>

<p>9th. Whenever the English army may arrive at Peshawur,
they will make arrangements for the return of Ameer
Dost Mahomed Khan, the Afghans and their families, that
are in India.</p>

<p>10th. That the English gentlemen, with their families,
will be left at Caubul as hostages, until the Ameer Dost
Mahomed Khan, with the rest of the Afghans and their
families, may arrive at Peshawur; or, secondly, that six
hostages may be left.</p>

<p>11th. After the departure of the English there shall be
perfect friendship between the two states, in so much so
that the Government of Afghanistan, without the advice
and approval of the British Government, shall enter into no
connection or correspondence with any other power; but if,
in its defence, it may require the assistance of the English,
they will not delay to afford it. Should the British Government
not consent to this, the Afghans are free to make
friends with any one they like.</p>

<p>12th. If any gentleman would wish to remain in Caubul,
on account of his private affairs, he may do so, and will be
treated with justice and respect.</p>

<p>13th. Whatever cash, whether gold or silver, may be in
the treasury, shall be paid to Newab Zemaun Khan. A
trustworthy person will be appointed, who will issue supplies
from stage to stage as far as Peshawur.</p>

<p>14th. With regard to artillery, six guns have been determined
on. They are enough. More will not be given.
Secondly, the three mule guns will be given.</p>

<p>15th. The spare arms shall be given to Newab Mahomed
Zemaun Khan.</p>

<p>16th. The hostages to be left here, and these persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>

<p>18th. If any of the Frank gentlemen have taken a
Mussulman wife, she shall be given up.</p>

<p>If there may be questions about any article, send a note
quickly by the bearer.&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

<p class="pc1">THE RATIFIED TREATY.</p>

<p class="ph p1"><i>Translation of a Treaty between the English Authorities at
Caubul and the Afghan Nobles. (Dated in the month
of Ze-vol-Kadh.)</i></p>

<p class="p1">The cause of writing this confidential paper, and the
intention of forming this unparalleled friendly treaty, is
this:&mdash;That at the present happy moment, to put away
strife and contention, and avert discord and enmity, the
representatives of the great English nation&mdash;that is, the
high of rank and respected Eldred Pottinger, the ambassador
and agent of the English Government, and General Elphinstone,
the commander of the English forces&mdash;have concluded
a comprehensive treaty containing certain articles,
which they have confided to the hands of the Afghan
nobility, that by it the chain of friendship may be strengthened.
And it has been settled that the Afghan nobles shall
give a similar writing.</p>

<p>An engagement is now made by his Majesty Newab
Mahomed Zemaun Khan, King of Afghanistan, and Naib
Ameen-oollah Khan, and the chief nobles of Afghanistan,
whose seals are affixed to and ornament this document. The
articles of the treaty are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Article 1.</i> That the British troops shall speedily quit the
territories of Afghanistan and march to India, and shall not
return; and twenty-four hours after receiving the carriage-cattle
the army shall start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Article 2.</i> That on our part the Sirdars, Oosman Khan
and Shoojah-ool-dowlah Khan, be appointed to accompany
the before-mentioned army to the boundaries of Afghanistan
and convey it to the boundary of the Sikh territory; so that
no one shall offer molestation on the road; and that carriage-cattle
and provisions may be procured for it.</p>

<p><i>Article 3.</i> That the English force at Jellalabad shall march
for Peshawur before the Caubul army arrives, and shall not
delay on the road.</p>

<p><i>Article 4.</i> Having brought the force at Ghuznee in safety
to Caubul, under the protection of one of the relations of
Naib Ameen-oollah Khan, we will send it to Peshawur unmolested
under the care of another trustworthy person.</p>

<p><i>Article 5.</i> Since, according to agreement the troops at
Candahar and other parts of Afghanistan are to start quickly
for India, and make over those territories to our agents, we
on our part appoint trustworthy persons who may provide
them with provisions and protection, and preserve them from
molestation.</p>

<p><i>Article 6.</i> All goods and property, and stores and cattle,
belonging to Sirdar Dost Mahomed Khan, which may be
in the hands of the English, shall be given up, and none
retained.</p>

<p><i>Article 7.</i> Six English gentlemen, who remain here as our
guests, shall be treated with courtesy. When the Ameer
Dost Mahomed Khan and the other Afghans shall arrive at
Peshawur, we will allow the above-mentioned English gentlemen
to depart with honour.</p>

<p><i>Article 8.</i> After the departure of the English army
according to the treaty, should assistance against foreign
invasion be at any time demanded, they (the English
Government) shall not delay. Between (the Governments)
friendship and good-will shall exist; and we will not make
a treaty with any but the above-mentioned English Government.
And in case the Governor-General of India should
not agree to this proposal, we are at liberty to form an
alliance with any other power.</p>

<p><i>Article 9.</i> Should any English gentleman be unavoidably
detained in Caubul, we will treat him with all respect and
consideration, and on his departure dismiss him with honour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Article 10.</i> The English can take six horse-artillery guns
and three mule guns, and the rest, by way of friendship,
shall be left for our use. And all muskets and ordnance
stores in the magazine shall, as a token of friendship, be
made over to our agents.</p>

<p><i>Article 11.</i> Such English soldiers as may be left sick or
wounded at Caubul shall be at liberty to return to their own
country on their recovery.</p>

<p>This is the treaty, the articles of which have been entered
into between the nobles of the Mahomedan faith and the
distinguished gentlemen. From which articles we will not
depart. Written in the month of Ze-vol-Kadh, in the year
of the Mahomedan faith 1257.</p>

<p class="pc2">CONDUCT OF AKBAR KHAN ON THE RETREAT.</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>Book VI., chapter IV, page 383.</i>]</p>

<p class="p1">“At about nine <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the chiefs of the pass and of the
country towards Soorkhab arrived, when we all sat down to
discuss matters. The chiefs were most bitter in their
expressions of hatred against us; and declared that nothing
would satisfy them and their men but our extermination,
and money they would not receive. The Sirdar, as far as
words went, tried all in his power to conciliate them, and
when other arguments failed, put them in mind of his
father and the whole of his family being in the power of
the British Government at Loodhianah, and that vengeance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
would be taken by the latter in the event of mercy not
being shown to us. Mahomed Shah Khan offered them
60,000 rupees on condition of our not being molested.
After some time they took their departure, to consult with
their followers; and Mahomed Shah Khan mentioned to
me that he feared the chiefs would not, without some great
inducement, resist the temptation of plunder and murder
that now offered itself, and wound up by asking if we would
give them two lakhs of rupees on condition of being allowed
a free passage. I mentioned this to General Elphinstone,
obtained his consent, and made known the same to Mahomed
Shah, who went away and promised to return quickly. The
General again begged of the Sirdar to permit him to return
to his troops; but without avail.”</p>

<p>“Until twelve o’clock crowds of Ghilzyes with their
respective chiefs continued to pour in from the surrounding
country to make their salaam to Mahomed Akbar; to participate
in the plunder of our unfortunate people; and to
revel in the delights of massacring the Europeans. From
their expressions of hatred towards the whole race of us
(whilst conversing in Persian, which they frequently did,
until from a hint of the Sirdar they began to talk in Pushtoo,
which I did not understand), they appeared to anticipate
much more delight in cutting our throats than even in
the expected booty. The Sirdar, to all appearance, but
possibly only as a blind to his real feelings, whilst sitting
with me endeavoured as much as possible to conciliate them.
The reply in two instances was, ‘When Burnes came into
this country, was not your father entreated by us to kill
him; or he would go back to Hindostan, and on some future
day return with an army and take our country from us. He
would not listen to our advice, and what is the consequence?
Let us, now that we have the opportunity, take advantage
of it and kill these infidel dogs.’”</p>

<p>“I must not omit to mention, that Mahomed Akbar
Khan told me in the morning, after Mahomed Shah Khan
had gone to consult with the chiefs of the pass, that the
latter were dogs, and no faith to be placed in them; and
begged that I would send for three or four of my most intimate
friends, that their lives might be saved in the event<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
of treachery to the troops. My reply was that I would
gladly do so, could my request be acceded to; but that the
commanding-officer would never consent, and that the feelings
of my friends would also be opposed to such a proceeding
at a time of so imminent peril to their comrades.
The Sirdar also proposed that in the event of the Ghilzyes
not acceding to our terms, he would himself, with his party
of horsemen, proceed at dusk to the foot of the hill, where
our troops were bivouacked; and previous orders having
been given by the commanding-officer that they should be
held ready, he would bring away in safety every European,
by desiring each of his horsemen to take up a man behind
him; that the Ghilzyes would not fire on the Europeans for
fear of hitting him or his men: but that he could not allow
a single Hindostanee to follow, as it was impossible for him
to protect 2000 people (our computed number). I mentioned
this to the General; but it was deemed impracticable, as,
from past experience, we had seen how impossible it was to
separate the non-combatants from the fighting men. Four
or five times during the day we heard the report of musketry,
which appeared in the direction of our troops, but
were always told, on making inquiry, that all fighting had
ceased.”&mdash;[<i>Captain Johnson’s Journal.</i>]</p>

The Envoy said, that as Dost Mahomed had sent guns over the
same road to Bameean, there was no reason why our guns should not
go. The Doctor-General Harlan boasted that he had crossed the
Hindoo-Koosh with artillery. But Macnaghten had not considered
that the guns which Dost Mahomed sent along these roads were
three-pounders, whilst ours were six-pounders. The troop came along
the wheel-track of the Ameer’s guns, and reported “the breadth between
the wheels less than half of that of ours.”</p>

The picturesque aspects of Caubul are well described by Lieutenant
Rattray: “It is well-built and handsome, and is one mass of bazaars.
Every street has a double row of houses of different heights, flat-roofed,
and composed of mud in wooden frames. Here and there a larch porch
of carved wood intervenes, giving entrance to the court-yard of the
residences of the nobles, in the centre of which is a raised platform of
mud, planted with fruit trees, and spread with carpets. A fountain
plays near; and here, during the heat of the day, loll the chiefs at
ease, listening, as they smoke their pipes, to the sound of the ‘saccringhi,’
or guitar, the falling water, or the wonderful tales of the
Persian story-teller. The houses overhang the narrow streets; their
windows have no glass, but consist of lattice-work wooden shutters,
which push up and down, and are often richly carved and otherwise
ornamented. The shop windows are open to the sun, and the immense
display of merchandise, fruits, game, armour, and cutlery defies
description. These articles are arranged in prodigious piles from floor
to ceiling; in the front of each sits the artificer engaged in his calling, or
from amidst the heaped-up profusion peeps out the trader at his visitors.
The grand bazaar (Char Chouk, or Chutta) has a substantial roof, built
in four arcades, which are decorated with painted panels, now nearly
indistinct, and originally watered by cisterns and fountains which are
neglected and dried up.”</p>

A passage in Lord Auckland’s unpublished minute of August 20,
1839, to which allusion has already been made, contains a summary of
the efforts of the Supreme Government to supply Macnaghten with
funds. It exhibits the fearful manner in which already the war was
beginning to tell upon the finances of India.</p>

“So completely is this poor man’s memory gone, that he never
recognises a man he has once seen; that the commonest business requires
half a dozen notes.”&mdash;[<i>Burnes to Macnaghten: August 7, 1840.
Unpublished Correspondence.</i>] “He had lost his memory to such an
extent that he could not recognise a person whom he had well known
before, if he had not seen him even for a day.”&mdash;[<i>Mohun Lal’s Life of
Dost Mahomed.</i>]</p>

“Every day complaints were made to us, and we permitted ourselves
to interfere, by giving notes to the complainants, requesting the
Moollah to settle their cases; but this did no good, for, instead of
having redress to their grievances, they were beaten, and sometimes
confined, for coming and complaining to us against the Shah’s authority.
All the chiefs or heads of tribes received their allowances from
certain villages, by obtaining an order from Moollah Shikore. If there
was any man among them known to us, and whom we would wish to
favour, the Moollah took care to annoy and vex him, by giving him an
order to a distant village for such sums which he would likely
spend during his journey; or else to poor villages, where there was
very little chance of gaining anything.”&mdash;[<i>Mohun Lal’s Life of Dost
Mahomed.</i>]</p>

“Immediately consequent on his Majesty’s accession, certain feelings
began to take root among the Douranees, in connexion with the
presence of British troops, which promised ill for the future tranquillity
of the country. Several of the most influential chiefs accompanied the
Court from Candahar to Caubul and Jellalabad; and although it must
have been with feelings of gratified pride that they beheld the leader
of their order&mdash;their <i>Shah Baba</i>, or Father King, as he was familiarly
named&mdash;seated upon the throne of his ancestors, yet it is also not
unreasonable to suppose that their mortification must have been great
at finding that they no longer possessed a dominant voice in the royal
councils, or the ability, as formerly, to render the sovereign the victim
of their intrigues, and that this conviction of their political influence
being for ever superseded, must have led them to value the many personal
advantages they had gained by the restoration, and to regard
with peculiar hostility the intruders upon their fancied rights. At
Candahar the progress of events had the same tendency to render the
Douranees discontented, if not actually inimical. The chiefs who had
remained with the tribes were of inconsiderable influence; but they
still looked, under the revived Suddozye monarchy, to be admitted to
the share of power which they deemed their right, and from which
they had been jealously excluded by the Sirdars. No such participation
whatever was extended to them. The present governor of the
province, being altogether disqualified by his youth and inexperience
to take an active part in the administration, the executive power was
vested almost entirely in the hands of Wullee Mahomed Khan, the
revenue manager, and the direction of the government was to the
same extent dependent upon British guidance.”&mdash;[<i>Major Rawlinson’s
Report on the Assessment of the Douranee Tribes.&mdash;MS. Records.</i>]
I have met with no abler official paper than this in the whole course
of my enquiries.</p>

The Supreme Government were desirous to place Burnes at Candahar,
with Leech as his assistant; but Burnes was disinclined to
leave Caubul; and the charge of the agency was entrusted to Leech.
In the August minute already mentioned, Lord Auckland thus sketches
the proposed political arrangements:&mdash;“Mr. Macnaghten will himself
be, of course, as much as possible near to the King. * * * *
I think a political agency, subordinate to the Mission at Caubul, should
be maintained at Candahar, and that it cannot be better entrusted
than to the approved zeal and ability of Sir Alexander Burnes. * * *
I would not disturb Lieutenant Pottinger at Herat. His name is
attached to the establishment of British influence in that city. He has
had a most difficult task to execute, and I would suspend all opinion
on the instructions with which it may be determined to furnish him,
until I have a report of the result of the mission of Major Todd. I
think, also, that Captain Bean should certainly remain in charge of the
political functions which have been committed to him at Quettah.
* * * Under these general arrangements, Major Leech will render
assistance at Candahar to Sir A. Burnes, and perhaps Dr. Login to
Lieutenant Pottinger at Herat; and Mr. Macnaghten will report in
detail upon the number of officers whose aid will be indispensably
necessary, under his own personal superintendence. He will have
with him Major Todd, Lieutenant Macgregor, and presently Messrs.
Lord, Leech, and Arthur Conolly. I am aware that the duties of his
office will be complicated and extensive. He may have missions to
send to Bokhara and Koondooz, and to other neighbouring states, and
I would not stint him in assistance.”&mdash;[<i>Minute of Lord Auckland:

The Khyburees fell upon them in their stockaded position before
attacking Jellalabad. The Nujeebs were suffering severely from sickness
at the time. One half of them, it is said, were ineffective when
the Khyburees fell upon them.</p>

Two companies of the 27th Native Infantry, under Lieutenant
Laing&mdash;a very gallant officer, who fell honourably at Caubul in the
winter of 1841-42, were sent by Sir John Keane to reinforce Ferris at
Ali-Musjid. Afterwards, two companies of the 21st, with one of sappers,
were despatched to throw provisions into the fort. On their
return they were attacked by the Khyburees in great force, and worsted,
with the loss of their cattle. Another party, sent by Sir John Keane
to throw ammunition into Ali-Musjid, was also attacked; two officers
were severely wounded, and some men killed; but the convoy ultimately
reached its destination. M’Leod, with his sappers, did good
service on this occasion.</p>

The private letters of Lieutenant Loveday (quoted in the <i>Asiatic
Journal</i>) throw some light upon the incidents of the capture. “In
one court-yard I saw a heap of their dead, some forty or fifty&mdash;some
very fine handsome fellows&mdash;their shields shot through, and broken
swords and matchlocks lying about in every direction, telling of the
fierce fight. There was still, however, a small party who obstinately
held out in an inner apartment; there was no going at them except by
a narrow passage, which admitted but of one at a time; three or four
attempted it, and were instantly shot dead. We offered them quarter,
but they would not trust us. At last I was sent up alone, when they
surrendered. * * * * I then went to the mother of Shah Newaz,
who is the new Khan, and who made his escape from prison seven
years ago. This poor creature, with a few old women, had been shut
up in a distant apartment ever since the flight of her son, miserably
fed and miserably clothed. I explained in a few words what had taken
place; our capture of the fort, the death of Mehrab Khan, and the
near approach of her son, whom our government had placed on the
<i>Musnud</i>. You may readily fancy the scene: what with surprise and
joy, she burst into tears, said she was my slave, and would have thrown
herself at my feet if I had not prevented her. On the following day a
few of Mehrab Khan’s servants brought the body of their master for
burial&mdash;a fine looking man. There was one little hole in his breast,
which told of a musket-ball having passed through. He had no clothes
on, except his silk <i>pyjammahs</i>. One of his slaves whispered me for
a shawl; alas! I had nothing of the kind, but luckily remembered a
brocade bed-cover, which I had bought in my days of folly and extravagance
at Delhi. I called for it immediately, and gave it to the Khan’s
servants, who were delighted with this last mark of respect, and wrapping
up the body in it, placed their deceased master on a <i>charpoy</i>, and
carried him to the grave.”</p>

In his minute of August 20, Lord Auckland wrote on this subject:&mdash;“Mr.
Macnaghten has authority, as respects the Khelat territories,
to declare the annexation of the provinces of Shawl, Moostung, and
Cutch Gundaya to the Afghan dominions; and I have but to add, that
it is my strong opinion that no power should be left in the hands of
Mehrab Khan, who has shown himself our bitter and deceitful enemy,
wholly unworthy of our confidence. For this object, it will, I conceive,
be sufficient to occupy Khelat itself, and to hold it and the districts
adjacent, in addition to Moostung and Shawl, under our provisional
management or superintendence, for the very short period that will
elapse, until it may be seen what final arrangement can be made respecting
it, either by bringing it also under the direct rule of the Shah,
or placing the claimant, Shah Newaz Khan (or any other Beloochee
chief), in possession of it.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

“As to Mehrab Khan himself, he may have claims upon Shah
Soojah-ool-Moolk, arising out of the important succour given to his

not fail to second any proposition of a liberal personal support to the
chief which the Shah may be disposed to make, in generous acknowledgment
of those services.”&mdash;[<i>Lord Auckland’s Minute: August 20,

The winter, however, was not wholly unproductive of military
events. A detachment was sent out under Colonel Orchard to reduce
the fort of Pushoot, which lies some fifty miles to the north-east of
Jellalabad, and to expel the “refractory chief” of the surrounding
district. The affair was a successful failure. Repeated attempts were
made by the Engineer, Pigou, to blow in the gate, after the Ghuznee
fashion; but the heavy rains had damaged the powder, which was
naturally bad; and every effort was unsuccessful. As there was no
hope of effecting an entrance in this manner; as Abbott and his artillery
had vainly exhausted their ammunition, and a considerable number
of our men had fallen under the fire of the fort, Orchard drew off the
assailants. Soon after their withdrawal, however, the enemy evacuated
the place.</p>

Finding that he had little hope of so establishing his influence
among the petty Oosbeg states, as to enable him, with their assistance,
to make an effort to regain his lost dominions, the Ameer had contemplated
a flight into the Persian territories. But the Governor of
Balkh intercepted the fugitive, and invited him to that place. Jubbar
Khan went on the part of the Ameer, and was detained until the arrival
of Dost Mahomed himself. Then the Ameer was informed that the
Khan of Bokhara desired the presence at his capital of the ex-ruler of
Caubul. Sorely perplexed, and almost helpless, but not without some
misgivings, Dost Mahomed then went to Bokhara.</p>

Mehrab Khan, the Wullee of Maimouna, said to Arthur Conolly,
in the autumn of 1840, “My ancestors were content to serve the King
of Caubul, and when members of that house fell into misfortune, they
found hospitality here. Shah Soojah is again upon his throne at
Caubul; but now another Suddozye King calls upon me to submit only
to Herat, and your English agent advises me to send my son there. On
the other hand, the Commander of the Faithful claims allegiance for
Bokhara. The Khan Huzzrut desires me to put myself under him; and
you know how I was forced to act when the Persian Asoph-ood-dowlah
crossed the Moorghaub.”</p>

On the 21st of March, Macnaghten had written to the Agra
Governor: “Lord Auckland tells me that the Russian force consists only
of 3000 cavalry Cossacks, 800 mounted artillerymen, and twelve light
field-pieces; but Burnes tells me that he knows, from good information,
that the force is much larger. Let us hope the armada may be
dispersed before it reaches Bokhara, whatever may be the strength of
it. If the Russians are likely to establish themselves there, we had
better be up and doing.”&mdash;(<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>)</p>
<p class="pfc4">But on the 15th of April he wrote from Jellalabad: “You will see
from Captain Abbott’s report how contemptible is the enemy with
which the Russians have to contend, and I fear they will experience no
obstacle to their progress all the way to Bokhara. Had we not been
here, they would by this time next year have established themselves
without the slightest opposition or difficulty in Afghanistan. They
appear to have completely gained over (whether by promises or threats)
the King of Bokhara, who turns a deaf ear to all our advances.”&mdash;(<i>MS.
Correspondence.</i>)</p>
<p class="pfc4">On the 23rd, the Court having then commenced its progress to
Caubul, the Envoy wrote in a still less confident strain: “All accounts
concur in stating that the Russians have reached Khiva, and I anticipate
anything but a bed of roses unless something be done to distract
people’s attention from the intrigues ahead, by putting a stop to those
in our rear. We are now on the field of battle on which Shah Soojah
lost his throne in 1810. What must his Majesty’s feelings be now?”</p>

“The price of flour in the Herat bazaar was, about this time, one

negotiations with Khiva. On our arrival at Herat, although the harvest
had been reaped, five maunds of flour were with difficulty procured
in the bazaar; and to meet the demand which the arrival of
the Mission (consisting of about 120 persons) occasioned, we had immediately
to send for supplies to Seistan.”&mdash;[<i>Facts relating to Herat, by

“When Major Todd, in June, 1839, arrived as envoy at Herat,
he selected Moollah Hussan, a Mahomedan priest of great respectability,
as bearer of a letter of friendship to the Khan Huzzrut
(Supreme Lord) of Khiva, called also Khaurism Shah, or King of
Khaurism. Moollah Hussan, arrived at Khiva when the state was
threatened with a Russian invasion, was well received; and on his
return was accompanied by an Oosbeg Lord, Shookkurroola Bre by
name, as ambassador from the Khan Huzzrut to the Indian Government.
The letter borne by this ambassador accepted of the tender of
British friendship, and made several demands which could not be complied
with on the responsibility of Major Todd. It was in answer to
this mission that the Envoy deputed me to visit the Court of Khiva.”&mdash;[<i>Captain
Abbott’s Narrative of a Journey from Herat to Khiva:
Preliminary Remarks.</i>] For an account of Captain Abbott’s personal
adventures, with a glimmering here and there of his political negotiations,
I would refer the reader to his interesting volumes. Abbott
says, at the commencement of his narrative: “We (Todd and Abbott)
separate under circumstances sufficiently gloomy. I leave him in the
very stronghold of robbers. I go myself as agent of the British
Government to a Court, of the language and manners of which I am
utterly ignorant, and to accomplish that of which the most sanguine
have no hope. It is simply a matter of duty, and as such
entered upon cheerfully, and with full determination to carry my efforts
to the utmost.”</p>

Ghorian, the frontier post of Herat, had been taken by the Persians
in 1838. When, in the spring of 1840, the perfidy of Yar
Mahomed was discovered, the Wuzeer expressed some contrition, and
an anxiety to prove his sincerity, by fitting out an expedition for the
recovery of Herat. All that he wanted was money. If the British
agent would advance him two lakhs of rupees, he would speedily
recover Ghorian. The money was advanced; and of course Ghorian was
not recovered. It was believed by the Mission that, whilst pretending
to make his preparations for the expedition, the Wuzeer was sending
messages to the Persian commandant at Ghorian, telling him not to be
under any apprehensions, for that although the British desired him to
recover the place, he had no intention of making the attempt.</p>

In Council, the Commander-in-Chief was consistently opposed to
the project of an advance on Herat or the countries beyond the Hindoo-Koosh.
On the 25th of May he wrote in his journal: “In a quiet
way, without any formality, I placed in the Governor-General’s hands
to-day in Council a paper detailing the numbers of regiments and
troops or companies of artillery now beyond our frontier. It is very
great: 1 troop and 5 companies of Artillery; 1 regiment of Native
Cavalry; 9 regiments of European and 15½ of Native Infantry; 2½
companies of Golundauze, and 2 companies of Sappers. I remarked
at the foot that this aggregate exceeded, except in horse artillery and
cavalry, the two armies which, in 1803, beat down the great army of
Scindiah, under Lake and Wellesley. I did this in the hope of inducing
Lord Auckland to pause before he sanctioned any advance upon Balkh
or to Herat, for we can ill afford any such extension of our force. In
truth, we are much weaker now than in 1838, when the first augmentation
was ordered in view to our later campaign.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Journal of

In connection with the Ghilzye affairs at this time, comes in the
unpleasant story of the surrender of Wulloo Khan. I believe that the
following account of the transaction, which appeared in a Calcutta
journal, is substantially correct: “Wulloo Khan, after his beating,
wished to make terms. Anderson allowed him to go into Candahar
to do so. He was successful, and received a dress of honour from
Major Leech, and one from the Shah-zadah ruling Candahar. He
declared he had been instigated to resistance by men in Candahar, and
that he would show their letters. He returned to Anderson, and then
to his home; when hearing that Lieutenant Nicolson and Shah-zadah
Timour were near, relying on the pledged words of our political agent,
Major Leech, and the Shah-zadah Futteh Jung, Wulloo Khan went to
make his obedience, and was immediately seized and made prisoner.
His letters and dress of honour, together with a strong protest against
such proceedings from Anderson, may have saved his head, but he is
sent prisoner to Caubul.” The writer adds, that “three of the prisoners
made over to Lieutenant Nicolson and the Shah-zadah Timour
had their heads struck off;” but I have before me a specific declaration,
made by the Envoy in a letter to Lord Auckland, dated November
24, 1840, that “not a single political execution has taken place since
his Majesty’s accession to power.”</p>

Commenting on the neglect of all ordinary precautions, by which
the insurrection had been suffered to make so much head in Upper
Sindh, Burnes, on the 7th of August, wrote to Macnaghten:&mdash;“In
April, 1839, when called upon by you to state officially what should
be done to chastise the treachery of the chief of Khelat, I recommended,
in common with yourself and Lord Keane, his deposition; but I as
plainly stated in my letter of the 10th of that month, ‘that while our
troops continued at Shawl, this may be an unnecessary arrangement
(to raise national troops), but both at Moostung and Cutchee very
energetic measures will be required to these countries; and happily
their resources are such, that this will amply repay the labour and
expense.’ Was this vigour displayed by his Majesty’s Government on
the spot, or by our own authorities? One of his Majesty’s governors
has joined the insurgents, and the political agent was taken by surprise
on an occasion which the slightest foresight might have anticipated.
What right have we to expect that any chief placed in power shall
flourish by us, unless his government is better than that which we
have overthrown? Did Shah Newaz muster or even organise his
troops? Did he point out the necessity for payment, or the means of
making them superior to his adversaries? We advanced him a lakh of
rupees, and allowed him to continue most at Caubul, while we withdrew
all our troops. Khelat is the capital of Beloochistan&mdash;a poor but
vast country, stretching from the mountains in sight of the Indus to
the confines of Persia. Through this wide tract our discomfiture
affects our reputation; the only solace in it will be found in our chief,
not our troops being vanquished.”-[<i>Papers privately printed.</i>]</p>

About this time Macnaghten had been much vexed by the conduct
of General Nott, who, from first to last, treated the royal family of
Caubul with the supremest contempt. Nothing could induce him to
behave towards any one of them with ordinary respect. At last
Macnaghten was compelled to lay his complaints before the Supreme
Government. “It was with much regret,” he wrote to Lord Auckland,
“that I felt compelled to refer to government a difference of opinion
between myself and Sir Willoughby, but if such an outrage as that
committed by General Nott is to be tolerated and justified, there must
be an end of our efforts to make it be believed that Shah Soojah is
king of this country. I know how embarrassing these references are,
and I should have been happy to have saved government the trouble of
passing orders on the question, had Sir Willoughby so far supported
me as to have conveyed a censure to General Nott for the deliberate
and gratuitous violence which he had committed. The <i>animus</i> by
which he has been actuated is apparent throughout&mdash;he refused to pay
the Prince the common compliment of calling upon him, although told
that such a civility was expected. There is, I regret to say, a feeling
too prevalent amongst the officers of the force against his Majesty, who
is considered the sole cause of their detention here&mdash;and I hope that
though they may not be compelled to treat the royal family with
becoming respect, yet that they will not be permitted to offer them a
direct insult with impunity.”</p>

Writing on the 1st of October, the Envoy thus sketched the aspect
of affairs: “The result of the victory at Bameean has not been by any
means such as I could have wished. Dost Mahomed will not come in,
and the Wullee of Khooloom will not give him up. The latter has
omitted to reply to Dr. Lord’s last overture, so I imagine we must
retreat from Syghan, <i>re infectâ</i>. Two of the Dost’s sons have escaped
from Ghizni, and they will no doubt endeavour, and probably with
success, to raise a disturbance in the Ghilzye country. In short, the
aspect of affairs is by no means agreeable, and we shall have abundance
of work on our hands for next season. Bajore, Khooloom, and divers
other places it will be requisite to visit with our arms before the
country can be called settled. Amongst a bigoted people accustomed
to anarchy, it never can be difficult to scatter the seeds of rebellion.”&mdash;[<i>MS.

Writing to the same correspondent shortly afterwards, he cautioned
him not to expect any very speedy or extensive reforms; and,
above all, not to look for any favourable financial results. “By-and-by
his Majesty,” said the Envoy, “will, I hope, be able to make both
ends meet. At present, pecuniary assistance to a considerable extent
will be indispensable. As I said when we first reached Candahar,
the country must be looked upon as an outwork, requiring large
expenditure to keep it in repair. You are a little too sanguine, I
think, in your hope of a speedy and universal reform in this country.
For thirty years the inhabitants of most of the districts have never
paid a fraction of revenue, until they were coerced into payment by
the presence of troops. The habit has grown into second nature with
them, and we cannot expect them to subside at once into the condition
of cheerful tax-payers.”&mdash;[<i>Unpublished Correspondence.</i>]</p>

Major Rawlinson went out to India as a cadet on the Bombay
Establishment in 1827. He was a fellow-passenger of Sir John Malcolm,
from whom he imbibed his earliest taste for Oriental literature.
In 1828, having passed, whilst yet a cadet, an examination in the
Hindostanee language, he was posted to the 1st Grenadier Regiment,
with which he served until 1833. In this interval he passed in two
other languages, Mahratta and Persian. In 1833, when Lord William
Bentinck despatched a party of officers to Persia to drill the army of
Abbas Meerza, Rawlinson, still an ensign, was selected as adjutant of
the detachment. In Persia he continued to serve until the rupture
with that state. During a space of nearly three years he was in military
command of the province of Kermanshah, living entirely among
the Persians, and becoming as familiar with their language and literature
as with his own. He graduated in diplomacy under Sir John
M‘Neill, by whom he was entrusted with various political duties,
and strongly recommended to Lord Auckland for employment in
Afghanistan.]</p>

Other grounds of complaint may have subsequently arisen, but
this dilatoriness was the first offence. Leech pleaded in extenuation
that he had been removed from one appointment to another,
before he had had time to make up the financial statements of his last
mission; and sent in a list of no less than <i>eight</i> different accounts of
which he had to bring up the arrears.&mdash;[<i>Major Leech to Sir W. H.

It would be foreign to the objects of this work to discuss the
question of Nott’s supercession. It was at one time a fertile subject
of discussion in India, involving, as it did, a general question of military
rank in the higher grades. General Willshire was an older officer
and an older lieutenant-colonel than General Nott, and the Indian
Commander-in-Chief had decreed that the relative ranks of the major-generals
should be determined, not by the dates of their brevets as
such, but by the dates of their lieutenant-colonels’ commissions.</p>

I cannot refrain from quoting here a letter on this subject
from Todd to Outram, written before his removal from political employment:</p>
<p class="pfc6">“Your kind letter of November 3rd reached me a few days ago.
I would fain send you an adequate return, but I am out of sorts, and,
besides, have but little to tell you. Shakespear’s proceedings have
been in all respects admirable. The zeal, perseverance, and judgment
he has displayed throughout his arduous undertaking, entitle him to
the highest praise; and I trust he will be rewarded as he deserves.
The property restored by Russia is valued at upwards of a crore of
rupees; and the number of merchants and others released, exceeds
600. The news was received at Khiva with every demonstration of
joy; and Shakespear’s name has been inserted in the calendar of
Oosbeg saints! The Russians, by liberating their captives immediately
on the arrival of Shakespear and his ‘company,’ have given a strong
proof that they are unwilling or unable to renew their attempt on
Khiva; and I hope that they will now be prevented taking up that
formidable position on the road to India. I cannot help congratulating
myself on even the small share which I have had in these proceedings.
Had I waited for orders, the Russians might have been within a few
marches of Khiva; and had we been satisfied with the tales of Sir
Alexander’s agents, we should have now believed the Russians 300,000
strong, and to be within as short a distance of Caubul. The road
between Teheran and this place is infested by roving bands of Toorkomans,
who have been let loose on Persian Khorassan by the Khan of
Khiva. His Highness thinks that he is thus doing us service; but I
have written to undeceive him in this matter, and I have pointed out
to him that the practice of man-stealing is abhorrent to us, whether
the man be a Russian or a Persian. His conduct on this occasion
reminds me of an answer given to me by Mahomed Shah’s Wuzeer, one
Meerza Mahomed, a great oaf. I had been superintending some artillery
practice at Teheran. A jackass having been placed at the target,
I remonstrated against the cruelty of putting up one of God’s creatures
as a mark, when wood or canvas would answer every purpose.
The Wuzeer replied, ‘On my eyes be it, I will stick up a pony next
time.’ As if I had specially pleaded the case of jackasses.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“Sheil thinks that the prospect of a settlement of our differences
with Persia is as distant as ever, and is strongly opposed to my plan
of allowing the Shah to keep Ghorian, and retaining possession of
Kharrack.”</p>

Nott’s disparagement of the Janbaz so irritated Macnaghten, and
displeased Lord Auckland, that his removal from Candahar was contemplated.
The following extracts from Macnaghten’s correspondence
show what was thought on the subject:&mdash;“<i>September 2.</i>&mdash;Between
you and me, Lord A. is much displeased with General Nott for his
light and indiscriminate censure and disparagement of the Janbaz;
and I think his displeasure will be increased when he peruses the
General’s subsequent and most uncandid despatch, in which he omitted
all notice of the exemplary conduct of the Janbaz at Secunderabad.”
“<i>September 5.</i>&mdash;You are not likely to have Nott with you much longer.
His conduct in respect to the Janbaz has elicited the severest displeasure
of government, by whom he has been declared disqualified for
his present important command.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Correspondence.</i>]</p>

His brigade was employed against the refractory tribes of the

<i>Sir Jasper Nicolls’ MS. Journal</i>&mdash;some passages of which may
be cited in illustration of this part of the inner history of the war:</p>
<p class="pfc6">“<i>March 12.</i>&mdash;My letter of the 10th of November will be found
difficult to parry, after all; and I regret to say, that the immense expenditure
cannot long be borne. A million a year will not cover our
charges; and Lord Auckland’s answers to the last week’s applications
prove to me that he begins to feel it.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“<i>March 21.</i>&mdash;We are called upon to make early and large remittances
to the Upper Provinces; and fifty lakhs have been ordered (their
requisitions increased in a week to eighty lakhs). Thirty lakhs went
last week to Bombay, and twenty-nine are now at Ferozepore, waiting
for transmission. This will never do. Even if we had a firmer hold
of Afghanistan than we have, we should be compelled to give it up,
for a drain of a million a year will infallibly swamp us. Even a good
share of the Punjab would not cover this great charge. Lord Auckland
is not inclined to look this in the face, and acknowledge by a loan
the unfortunate result of our successes.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“<i>March 26.</i>&mdash;Lord Auckland sent home a long minute regarding
Herat.... He means to preserve our footing in Afghanistan. Mr.
Bird and Mr. Prinsep approve of this, though the latter roundly and
justly asserts that it cannot be done under a crore and a quarter (a
million and a quarter) annually; and that no present mode of extending
our receipts to that extent, is open to us. Lord Auckland wrote
a note to ask our opinions on the subject. Mr. Maddock never circulated
the note. Sir W. Casement and myself were therefore silent.
We are clearly in a great scrape. That country drains us of a million
a year and more; and we only in truth are certain of the allegiance
of the people within range of our guns and cavalry.... One
part of Lord Auckland’s paper only will be received for a time. He
states our resources to be only a crore less than when we crossed the
Indus. The Accountant-General says, that on the 30th of April we
may expect the reduction to amount to three crores and
three-quarters. I told Prinsep that he had been very complaisant not to
point this out.”</p>

<i>Sir Jasper Nicolls’ MS. Journal, March 29.</i>&mdash;“At last the
advertisement for a loan is prepared, and will shortly appear. Though
Lord Auckland did not advert to a deficiency of three-and-a-half
crores in his paper on Afghanistan, he now acts upon it. This will
force on the Court a decision as to our maintaining our position in
that quarter at such a price, for they will assuredly never pay even the
charges of the Shah.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“<i>May 12.</i>&mdash;Before I close this book (volume of the Journal), I
would record my opinion, that the whole thing will break down. We
cannot afford the heavy, yet increasing drain upon us. Nine thousand
troops between Quettah and Kurachee; at least 16,000 of our
army and the Shah’s to the north of Quettah. The King’s expenses
to bear in part&mdash;twenty-eight political officers to pay, besides Macnaghten&mdash;Dost
Mahomed’s allowance&mdash;barracks&mdash;a fort or two to
build&mdash;loss by exchange, &amp;c., &amp;c. To me it is alarming. The silver
does not return, and it is becoming scarce.”</p>

India drained of a million and a quarter annually for a rocky frontier,
requiring about 25,000 men and expensive establishments to hold it
even by threats, as at present. The specie, too, is drawn away not to
return. Little comes from China. How is it to end? Money is not
rapidly subscribed to the loan, because it gains twelve to eighteen
per cent. for short periods elsewhere&mdash;amongst natives, twenty-four
per cent. or more. Unless a large accession of Punjab territory comes
in to connect us safely with Caubul, and to aid our very heavy expenses,
<i>we must withdraw</i>.”</p>

“<i>October 11.</i>&mdash;One down, t’other come on, is the principle with
these vagabonds; and lucky for us that it is so. No sooner have we
put down one rebellion than another starts up. The Eastern Ghilzyes
are now in an uproar, and our communications with Jellalabad are
completely cut off. This state of things&mdash;<i>Inshallah!</i>&mdash;will not last
long. Only imagine the impudence of the rascals in having taken up
a position, with four or five hundred men, in the Khoord-Caubul Pass,
not fifteen miles from the capital. I hope they will be driven out of
that either to-day or to-morrow; but the pass is an ugly one to force.
They fired last night upon the 35th Regiment, and succeeded in killing
or wounding twenty-four Sepoys. Tugao has been the nursery,
and Humza Khan the dry-nurse of this insurrection. Tugao will be
visited, I hope, in a day or two, and I have solicited his Majesty to
put Humza in durance vile, and to confiscate all his property. This
<i>émeute</i> of ours is particularly provoking just as I am about to quit
Afghanistan. I had hoped to leave the country in perfect tranquillity;
and I still think that it will be quieter than ever it was,
after the insurrection is put down. It is particularly provoking that
Macgregor is absent with a large portion of our force at this juncture.
My accounts from Burn at Gundamuck are very satisfactory. The
efforts of the rebels to raise the tribes are as unavailing as incessant.

I must give Mohun Lal’s own words, in spite of their eccentric
phraseology: “On the 1st of November,” he writes, “I saw Sir Alexander
Burnes, and told him that the confederacy has been grown very
high, and we should fear the consequence. He stood up from his chair,
sighed, and said he knows nothing but the time has arrived that
we should leave this country.”&mdash;[<i>Letter of Mohun Lal to J. R. Colvin,
Esq., January 9, 1842.</i>&mdash;<i>MS. Records.</i>] In a letter to another correspondent,
Mohun Lal makes a similar statement; and adds that, upon
the same night, Taj Mahomed called upon Burnes, to no purpose, with
a like warning: “On the 1st of November I saw him at evening, and
informed him, according to the conversation of Mahomed Meerza Khan,
our great enemy, that the chiefs are contriving plans to stand against
us, and therefore it will not be safe to remain without a sufficient
guard in the city. He replied, that if he were to ask the Envoy to
send him a strong guard, it will show that he was fearing; and at the
same [time] he made an astonishing speech, by saying that the time is
not far when we must leave this country. Taj Mahomed, son of
Gholam Mahomed Khan, the Douranee chief, came at night to him,
and informed what the chiefs intended to do, but he turned him out
under the pretended aspect that we do not care for such things. Our
old friend, Naib Sheriff, came and asked him to allow his son, with
100 men, to remain day and night in his place till the Ghilzye affair is
settled&mdash;but he did not agree.”&mdash;[<i>Letter of Mohun Lal to Dr. James

This is stated on the authority of Sir William Macnaghten: “I
may be considered culpable,” he said, in an unfinished memorandum,
found after his death, “for not having foreseen the coming storm; to
this I can only reply that others, who had much better opportunities
of watching the feelings of the people, had no suspicion of what was
coming. The late Sir A. Burnes was with me the evening before the
insurrection occurred, and it is a singular fact that he should have
congratulated me on my approaching departure at a season of such profound
tranquillity.”&mdash;[<i>Unpublished Papers of Sir W. H. Macnaghten.</i>]

of his Majesty to put all infidels to death, and this, of course, gained
them a great accession of strength. But his Majesty has behaved
throughout with the most marked fidelity, judgment, and prudence.

This, however, in all probability is a very exaggerated statement.
There were, probably, not more than two or three hundred people in
the Caubul bazaars opposing the march of the regiment. Eyewitnesses
affirm that the latter fought with little gallantry on this

<i>Captain Johnson’s Journal.</i>&mdash;Eyre says that the commencement
of the insurrection was “an attack by certainly not 300 men on the
dwellings of Sir Alexander Burnes and Captain Johnson.” The precise
number of the rioters, at the commencement of the outbreak, is
of little consequence. All are agreed in opinion as to the insignificance
of the movement, and the facility with which it might have been suppressed.
It seems probable that, as Mohun Lal says, there were only
some thirty men there by previous concert, but that the number was
swelled by accidental rioters, moved by the greed of plunder. To the
evidence already adduced in the text, may be added that of Lalla
Gungadeen, a hospital gomastah (or steward) attached to Captain
Johnson’s establishment, who says, “For three or four days, it was
the general belief that there was no formidable foe to contend against&mdash;perhaps
merely a small body, similar to a gang of <i>decoits</i>. If at
this time an attack had been made upon the city, it would have been
well. One ‘pultun’ would have been enough. The people were in
great terror, and said every moment, ‘They are coming&mdash;they are
coming.’”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

General Elphinstone speaks of this party as a reinforcement. He
says: “On the 4th instant another attempt to throw in reinforcements
failed. The troops employed suffered considerably, particularly
the 5th Cavalry.” Two different attempts are here mixed up together.
Captain Johnson says, that the first was an attempt to reinforce Lieutenant
Warren; but that the second, on which the 5th Cavalry were
employed, was an attempt to bring off the commissariat guard. Lieutenant
Eyre and Lady Sale speak of <i>both</i> movements in the light of
efforts made to enable Lieutenant Warren to abandon his position. It
is certain that the second was.</p>

“About four o’clock on the morning of the 9th,” says Brigadier
Shelton, “I got a note from Elphinstone calling me into cantonments,
desiring me to take the Shah’s 6th Infantry and a 6-pounder gun with
me. I left the Balla Hissar between six and seven, and marched in
broad daylight without the enemy attempting to dispute my passage.
I was all prepared for opposition had any been made. I was cordially
received, but could read anxiety in every countenance, and they had
then only three days’ provisions. I was sorry to find desponding conversations
and remarks too generally indulged, and was more grieved
to find the troops were dispirited. Never having been much in cantonments,
I went round and found them of frightful extent&mdash;the two
sides of the oblong, including the two mission compounds, about 1400
yards each, the two ends each 500, with a rampart and ditch an Afghan
could run over with the facility of a cat, with many other serious
defects. The misfortune of this was that so many troops were necessary
for the actual defence of the works, that only a few could be
spared for external operations. I was put in orders to command cantonments,
and consequently, in course of my inspections, gave such
orders and instructions as appeared to me necessary. This, however,
Elphinstone soon corrected, by reminding me that he commanded, not
I.”&mdash;[<i>Statement of Brigadier Shelton.</i>&mdash;<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

“On the 9th,” says General Elphinstone, in the memorandum
which I have before quoted, “not finding myself equal to the duties,
particularly at night, when I could not go about on horseback, I recalled
Brigadier Shelton from the Balla Hissar, but I regret to be
obliged to disclose that I did not receive from him that cordial co-operation
and advice I had a right to expect; on the contrary, his
manner was most contumacious; from the day of his arrival he never
gave me information or advice, but invariably found fault with all that
was done, and canvassed and condemned all orders before officers,
frequently preventing and delaying carrying them into effect. This and
many other instances of want of assistance I can corroborate by the
evidence of several officers still living. Had I been so fortunate as to
have had Sir Robert Sale, than whom I never met any officer more
disposed to do everything for the public service []. I wish I
could say the same of Brigadier Shelton,&mdash;he appeared to be actuated
by an ill-feeling towards me. I did everything in my power to remain
on terms with him. I was unlucky also in not understanding the
state of things, and being wholly dependent on the Envoy and others
for information.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

“When the party got in motion the enemy retreated on all sides.
One very large body, however, remained in a position on the mountain
side, threatening the flank of the column. Ensign Salisbury was
detached with a company to remove this. The enemy retreated as they
advanced, and the Goorkhas being young soldiers, having once got
heated, followed with great eagerness, despite the frequently sounded
recall; and on their finally stopping, the enemy perceived they were
too far separated from the main body, and followed them up with a
boldness which obliged Mr. Salisbury to make frequent halts. In
consequence, Mr. Haughton was obliged to halt the convoy, and detach
the greater part of his men, to extricate the compromised company.
This halt encouraged the other parties of the enemy, who had retired,
and they closed in from all sides in most formidable array (apparently
not less than 4000 men). Mr. Haughton, however, maintained his
ground till joined by Mr. Salisbury, when, seeing the hopelessness of
making good his way, he retreated and gained the barracks in safety.
A great number of men fell in the retreat, as they were obliged frequently
to halt, formed in close order to resist the enemy’s cavalry,
which, being closely on them, was only kept in check by the gallantry
of Mr. Haughton, who, with a few men and the gun, remained in the
rear, and covered the retreat of the disheartened party. Mr. Salisbury
was mortally wounded, and the trail of the field-gun gave way

“In the castle of Lughmanee,” writes Pottinger, in his official
report, “we abandoned the hostages from the Kohistan chiefs, two
boxes of treasure, containing 10,000 rupees, and about sixty Afghan
firelocks (confiscated from the deserters of the Kohistan corps), all my
official records, Mr. Rattray’s, Dr. Grant’s, and my own personal property,
and a very large number of horses belonging to ourselves and
the horsemen who had not deserted. The Heratees and seven or eight
Peshawerees were the only Afghans who adhered to me. All the
Caubulees deserted, and one principal cause of so immediate a termination
to my defence may be traced to the reduction of a portion of
my escort, which had so disgusted the men who remained, that they
deserted as soon as Mr. Rattray was killed.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

Havildar Mootee Ram, of the Goorkha regiment, who gave a detailed
account of the defence of Charekur, described this attack on their
position by saying, “there were whole <i>beegahs</i> (acres) of gleaming
swords moving towards us.”</p>

“Some sheep were given to us by the officers; we found relief
from sucking the raw flesh, and some of the men placed the contents
of the stomach of the sheep in cloths, and, ringing them very hard,
obtained some moisture to assuage their raging thirst. The sick and
wounded now increased to a frightful amount, and were continually
screaming for water in piercing accents. Our muskets were so foul
from incessant use, that the balls were forced down with difficulty,
although separated from the paper of the cartridge which usually
wraps them round. The lips of the men became swollen and bloody,
and their tongues clave to their palates.”&mdash;[<i>Evidence of Mootee Ram,

Major Pottinger does not mention in his report when and how
these officers fell. Lieutenant Melville, in his narrative, says: “From
all that can be gathered from the reports brought in, it appears that
the devoted corps had struggled on to Kardurrah, gallantly headed by
Ensign Rose and Dr. Grant, where it was cut to pieces. The former
officer fell, having first killed four of the enemy with his own hand;
and the latter, although he contrived to escape from the murderous hands
at Kardurrah, yet just as he had arrived in the sight of the haven
of his hopes, within three miles of the cantonments, was massacred
by some wood-cutters.”</p>

This account of the defence of Charekur and the destruction of
the Goorkha corps, is taken from Major Pottinger’s Badeeabad Report
(MS.). Eyre seems to have had access to it. I have learnt since the
original edition of this book was published, that Captain Colin Mackenzie,
with characteristic self-devotion, offered to proceed, with 200
horse to Charekur, and convey ammunition to Pottinger. This aid
might have saved the Goorkha corps.</p>

<i>Correspondence of Sir W. H. Macnaghten.</i>&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>] A
version of this letter is given in the published papers; but there are
some curious errors in the official text, which illustrate, in a very
forcible manner, the value of these public documents as guides to historical
truth. The private letter, in spite of its very unofficial style,
is turned into an official one, commencing, “Sir.”&mdash;The words, “the
weather is very cold,” are printed “the <i>water</i> is very cold;” and instead
of “We must look for support chiefly from Peshawur,” Macnaghten
is made to say, “We must look for <i>supplies</i> chiefly from
Peshawur.” The evils of such carelessness as this have received a
remarkable illustration in Major Hough’s <i>Review of the Military
Operations at Caubul</i>, in which are some pages of remark on the subject
of <i>Supplies from Peshawur</i>, based upon this identical passage in
the mis-copied or mis-printed letter.</p>

Eyre says, that “though to carry the sick would be <i>difficult</i>, it
still was not <i>impossible</i>; for so short a distance two or even three men
could be conveyed in one <i>doolie</i>: some might manage to walk, and the
rest could be mounted on yaboos, or camels, at the top of their loads.”
He says, too, that “if we had occupied the Seeah Sungh hill with a
strong party, placing guns there to sweep the plains on the cantonment
side, the enemy could have done little to impede our march without
risking a battle with our whole force in fair field, to which they
were generally adverse, but which would, perhaps, have been the <i>best</i>
mode for <i>us</i> of deciding the struggle.”</p>

Lady Sale says: “Osman Khan was heard by our Sepoys to order
his men not to fire on those who ran, but to spare them. A chief,
probably the same, rode round Kershaw three times when he was
compelled to run with his men; he waved his sword over his head,
but never attempted to kill him; and Captain Trevor says his life
was several times in the power of the enemy, but he was also spared.”</p>

No small quantity of military criticism has been lavished upon
this unfortunate action of the 23rd of November. Eyre’s criticisms
are well known; and their soundness has been acknowledged by almost
every subsequent writer. Major Hough, however, says, with reference
to Eyre’s assertion that Shelton formed his infantry into squares on
the Beh-meru hill, that the Brigadier assured him that he formed no
squares at all, but only threw back his flanks <i>en potence</i>. Captain
Evans, of the 44th, also assured him that there were no squares.
Every other writer, however, makes a similar assertion relative to the
squares on the Beh-meru hill. Of the atrocity of the single gun there
is only one opinion. With regard to the general plan of operations,
Lady Sale says: “The misfortunes of the day are mainly attributable
to Shelton’s bad generalship, in taking up so unfavourable a position
after his fault in neglecting to surprise the village and occupy, which
was the ostensible object of the force going out.” But I have shown
that it was not Shelton’s fault that the village was not surprised. A
simultaneous attack on the village and on the hill was the course
recommended by the Brigadier; but he was overruled in council. He
went into action feeling certain that the plan mapped out for him
was a wrong one&mdash;and the battle was not fought the better for the feeling
that he had been thwarted and opposed.</p>

Principally cabbages. It was apprehended by some that the

It was generally believed in the cantonments that he had died from
the effects of his wounds. Lady Sale says: “Abdoollah Khan’s
death has, it is said, created some confusion in the city. Whilst still
living a report was spread of his decease; and, like Alexander, he
mounted his horse and showed himself to his followers; but the
exertion was too great for him, and he shortly after expired.”&mdash;<i>See</i>

It was believed by the British that he had been poisoned. Lady

they said that Khan Shereen was with them&mdash;the party being Jewan
Khan, Jubbar Khan, Oosman Khan, Mahomed Akbar Khan, Ameen-oollah
Khan, and Khan Shereen Khan. I suspect, from the insertion
of the name of the last mentioned, that the whole thing is a fabrication.
Let me know your opinion on this point. I replied to their

of his Majesty.”</p>

The garrison consisted of about 100 men, 40 being Europeans,
under the command of Lieutenant Hawtrey, 37th N.I. Lady Sale
says: “The Afghans planted their crooked sticks, which served them
for scaling ladders; got up one by one; pulled out the mud (with
which the window had been blocked up) and got in. A child with a
stick might have repulsed them. The Europeans had their belts and
accoutrements off, and the Sepoys the same. They all ran away as
fast as they could! The 44th say that the 37th ran first, and as they
were too weak they went too. Hawtrey says there was not a pin to
choose&mdash;all cowards alike. After he was deserted by the men, he himself
threw six hand grenades before he followed them.... It
was the most shameful of all the runaways that occurred.”</p>

Lady Sale says that the 44th wished to wipe out the stain on the
name, as did the Sepoys also (the 37th N.I.). Lieutenant Hawtrey’s
company volunteered to go with him and “take it without the assistance
of any other troops.” The General sent a message to the engineer
officer (Lieutenant Sturt) asking if the fort was practicable and tenable&mdash;that
is, whether our men could take it and hold it. Sturt’s answer
is worth recording&mdash;“Practicable if the men will fight&mdash;tenable if they
don’t run away.”</p>

The General had announced, as early as the 6th of November, that

“On the morning of the 23rd,” says General Elphinstone, “I
received a note from the Envoy, saying that he hoped he had made an
arrangement which would enable us to remain in the country; and
that he would shortly acquaint me with all the particulars. I soon
afterwards received a message from him, desiring to see me, when he
informed me that he had made an arrangement with Mahomed Akbar,
by which Shah Soojah would remain on the throne&mdash;Mahomed Akbar
being Wuzeer. He was to receive a large sum of money, and Ameen-oollah
was to be delivered to us a prisoner. I then asked what part
Newab Zeman Khan and Oosman Khan were to take in this? To
which I received answer that they were not in the plot. I replied
that I did not like the word ‘plot’&mdash;that it was an ominous one&mdash;and
I begged to know if there were no fear of treachery? The Envoy’s
reply was, ‘None whatever&mdash;I am certain the thing will succeed. What
I want you to do is to have two regiments and guns got quickly ready,
and, without making any show, to be prepared the moment required
to move towards Mahmood Khan’s fort.’ I further discussed with
him the danger he was incurring; but he replied, ‘Leave it all to me&mdash;I
understand these things better than you do.’ I then left him, and
he shortly afterwards proceeded with his suite and a few of his cavalry
escort to the interview. Before we separated, I asked him if there was
anything else I could do? He replied, ‘Nothing, but to have the two
regiments and two guns in readiness, and the garrison to be on the
alert;’ which was accordingly ordered.”</p>

Captain Grant, the adjutant-general of the Caubul force. “It
seems,” says Captain Mackenzie, “that Mahomed Akbar had demanded
a favourite Arab horse belonging to Captain Grant, assistant adjutant-general
of the force. To avoid the necessity of parting with the animal,
Captain Grant had fixed his price at the exorbitant sum of 5000
rupees. Unwilling to give so large a price, but determined to gratify
the Sirdar, Sir William sent me to Captain Grant to prevail upon him
to take a smaller sum, but with orders that, if he were peremptory,
the 5000 rupees should be given. I obtained the horse for 3000
rupees, and Sir William appeared much pleased with the prospect of
gratifying Mahomed Akbar by the present.”&mdash;[<i>Captain Mackenzie’s

both the evacuation of Afghanistan and the restoration of Dost Mahomed.

“Some time after I had given the necessary orders (for the two
regiments and the guns), Captain Anderson came to me and said,
‘They have seized the Envoy;’ and one of the escort at the same
time said, ‘They have seized the Lord Sahib and taken him off to the
city.’ By myself and others it was thought at the time that Sir
William had proceeded to the city for the purpose of negotiating. I
was also told that a few shots had been fired. The garrison was
got ready and remained under arms all day.”&mdash;[<i>Statement of General

On these additional hostages being sent, Captains Skinner and
Mackenzie, who had been detained in the city, were released. Captains
Lawrence and Mackenzie have each drawn up a narrative of the
circumstances attending their capture, and their detention in the city,
the former in the house of Ameen-oollah, and the latter in that of
Akbar Khan. Both the English officers owed their lives to the efforts
of the chiefs, who, at much personal risk, defended them against the
furious assaults of the <i>Ghazees</i>. “I must do Mahomed Akbar the
justice to say,” writes Captain Mackenzie, “that finding the Ghazees
bent on my slaughter, even after I had reached his stirrup, he drew
his sword and laid about him right manfully, for my conductor and
Meerza Baoodeen Khan were obliged to press me up against the wall,
covering me with their own bodies, and protesting that no blow should
reach me but through their persons. Pride, however, overcame
Mahomed Akbar’s sense of courtesy, when he thought I was safe, for
he then turned round to me, and repeatedly said, in a tone of triumphant
derision, ‘Shuma moolk-i-ma gereed’ (You’ll seize my country,
will you?)” The conduct of Akbar Khan and other chiefs towards
Lawrence and Mackenzie may be taken as a presumptive proof that
the murder of the Envoy was not designed. His seizure, however, was
deliberately planned between Ameen-oollah and Akbar Khan.</p>

The following extracts from Captain Johnson’s Journal will show
better than anything else the indignities to which they were subjected:
“<i>December 28.</i>&mdash;Very busy, buying camels and yaboos&mdash;the
price of the former 160 rupees each. The Ghazees still infest our
gates and insult us in every possible way&mdash;stop our supplies coming
in from the town, and abuse and ill-treat those who bring them. No
notice taken by our military leader, although our officers and soldiers
are burning for revenge. Several of my native friends from the city
come daily to see me, and all agree, without one dissenting voice, that we
have brought the whole of our misfortunes upon ourselves, through the
apathy and imbecility displayed at the commencement of the outbreak.
They also tell me that our safety on the retreat depends solely on ourselves&mdash;that
no dependence is to be placed on the promises of any of
the chiefs, and more especially Mahomed Akbar Khan. Every one of
them will now, that they are in a measure paid before-hand, do his
utmost to destroy us. <i>December 30.</i>&mdash;A body of Ghazees made a rush
at the rear gate of cantonments; but did not effect an entrance. More
guns and ammunition made over to the enemy, or what are called our
new allies. Precious <i>allies</i>, who are only waiting the opportunity to
annihilate us!... <i>December 31.</i>&mdash;The chiefs say they cannot
control their men, and that if their people misbehave themselves at
our gates, or around our walls, we must fire upon them. No orders,
however, given by General Elphinstone to punish our insulting foe,
who naturally attribute our forbearance to dastardly cowardice, and
take every opportunity of taunting us with it. The error lies with our
leader, not with our troops. Several camels laden with grain plundered
close to the Seeah-Sung gateway, within a few paces of a gun
loaded with grape, and a large guard of Europeans and Natives. No
steps taken to recover the plundered grain or punish the offenders.
How we must be despised by our miserable foe! Mahomed Zemaun
Khan sent in word that some of the chiefs will be in attendance to
escort us to Jellalabad to-morrow. In the evening another message
came that we must halt another day. Every day’s delay increases our
difficulties on the road. <i>January 1, 1842.</i>&mdash;New Year’s Day! God
grant that we may never see such another. My kind friends, Naib
Shureef, and Khan and Ali Reza Khan (both Kuzzul-bashes), sent me
in secretly some very excellent cakes to carry with me on the road, as
we shall not get a particle of firewood for cooking for a distance of
ninety miles, ere we can get into a milder climate. How dreary a
prospect we have before us&mdash;having to traverse ninety miles, and the
greater part of this distance through snow now upwards of a foot deep
and the thermometer at night below zero. Some negotiations still going
on. All the firewood that was laid in for the winter’s consumption
expended, and almost every tree in cantonments cut down. They had
long ago been stripped of their bark, and everything eatable, for the
purpose of feeding our starving cattle.”&mdash;[<i>MS. Records.</i>]</p>

In this letter, written from Jellalabad (Nov. 15), General Sale
says: “I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th
instant, requiring the force under my command to move again upon
Caubul. In reply, I beg to represent that the whole of my camp-equipage
has been destroyed; that the wounded and sick have increased
to upwards of 300; that there is no longer a single depôt of
provisions on the route; and that the carriage of the force is not sufficient
to bring on one day’s rations with it. I have, at the same time,
positive information that the whole country is in arms, and ready to
oppose us in the defiles between this city and Caubul, whilst my ammunition
is insufficient for more than two such contests as I should
assuredly have to sustain for six days at least. With my present
means I could not force the passes of either Jugdulluck or Koord-Caubul,
and even if the <i>débris</i> of my brigade did reach Caubul, I am given to
understand that I should find the troops now garrisoning it without the
means of subsistence. Under these circumstances, a regard for the
honour and interests of our government compels me to adhere to my
plan already formed, of putting this place into a state of defence, and
holding it, if possible, until the Caubul force falls back upon me, or
succours arrive from Peshawur or India.”</p>

<p class="pfi6">“Notre situation devient perilleuse de plus en plus; les forts à
l’entour du cantonnement ayant été rendus aux chefs, selon le traité que
le feu Envoyé et Ministre avoit commencé. Nous nous trouvons dans
la necessité de renouveler les negociations depuis qu’il a été tué. Le

des moyens de transport pour nos malades et blessés, qu’ils nous ont

<p class="pfn4"><span class="smcap">My dear Macgregor</span>,</p>
<p class="pfi6">Pottinger being busy, I write to tell you of the Envoy being murdered,
and Trevor, on the 23rd. We have been obliged to conclude the
treaty, and it is settled we march to-morrow. Whether we are attacked
on the road depends upon their good faith. I believe we do not
run very much risk as far as Jugdulluck, except from the weather,
which is very severe here; and we are obliged to march very lightly,
and may expect to lose many men. Orders have been sent to you to
evacuate Jellalabad before our arrival: if, however, the treaty is broken
by our being attacked, you will consider the orders cancelled, and you
will use every exertion to aid us. We have received your letter of the
24th, but our word cannot be broken. Pottinger wishes you, if possible,
to send intelligence of these matters to government and Rawlinson,
that the latter may be aware of the state of affairs, and not do
anything hurriedly. If you understand faith has been kept and are
obliged to leave Jellalabad, you had better not pass the Khybur till
we come, as it is feared our troops will be so disorganised as to require
your aid through that pass. If you could take supplies for us
to the mouth of the Khybur, it would be very desirable. We are all
well. Lady M(acnaghten) ditto, though still much afflicted. Keep
your scouts on the road, and give us as much intelligence as you can.
You must chiefly depend on yourself for news of us, as all our
Afghans have deserted us. We have no money in our treasury; so
tell Mackeson to have some ready for us, if possible.</p>

escape except one man, and that he would come to tell that the rest

“About eleven o’clock, when about half of the column had moved
off, I received a letter from Newab Zemaun Khan, remonstrating
against our march. But as the enemy had been enabled to seize the
enclosures of the late Envoy’s house and offices, owing to the early
withdrawal of our guards, we could not consent without commencing
an action for the recovery of part of our works. I represented this to
the Newab, and begged Mr. Conolly to explain our situation. In consequence,
about one <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, I received another letter from the Newab,
agreeing to our movement, and promising that he would protect us as
far as he could; and it is my duty to state that he did so to the
utmost of his power; but the quantity of baggage delayed the march
of the rear-guard, which was obliged to retreat with severe loss,
abandoning two guns and much baggage, notwithstanding it did not
reach the bivouac at Begramee till two the next morning.”&mdash;[<i>Major

Brigadier Shelton says: “I knew nothing of the arrangements for
the retreat till they were published the evening before. The order
was for the baggage to assemble at eight <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> At that hour I went to
Elphinstone’s quarters, to beg he would let the carriages of the gun-waggons
go out that were to form a foot-bridge for the infantry over
the Caubul river, about 300 yards from cantonments, and got offended
for my trouble. He was just sitting down to breakfast. They did
not go out till between nine and ten, and having to be dragged through
a canal caused further delay, so that the bridge was not completed for
the advanced-guard to pass till past twelve.”&mdash;[<i>Statement of Brigadier

Eyre says that “the General had often been urged to destroy these
guns rather than suffer them to fall into the enemy’s hands; but he
considered that it would be a breach of the treaty to do so.” We cannot
restrain a smile at Elphinstone’s simplicity; but at the same time,
the circumstance noted affords rather a pleasant indication of the
General’s honesty of purpose and singleness of character. As an honourable
English gentleman, having covenanted to give up his guns, he
considered himself bound to deliver them over in the state in which
they were at the time the covenant was made. The enemy do not
seem to have appreciated Elphinstone’s generosity, for they burned the
carriages of the guns, as soon as our troops evacuated the cantonments.</p>

A writer in the <i>Calcutta Review</i> says: “Major Pottinger told us
that when the retreat was decided on, and no attention was paid to
his, Lawrence’s, and Conolly’s advice to concentrate in the Balla
Hissar, he urged the officers to have all the old horse-clothing, &amp;c.,
cut into strips, and rolled round the soldiers’ feet and ankles after the
Afghan fashion, as a better protection against snow than the mere hard
leather shoes. This he repeatedly urged, but in vain, and within a
few hours the frost did its work. Major Pottinger said that there was
not an Afghan around them who had not his legs swathed in rags as
soon as the snow began to fall.”</p>

The mountain-train guns here fell into the enemy’s hands, in spite
of the gallantry of Lieutenant Green, who was in charge, and the
artillerymen under his command. Green succeeded in spiking the guns,
but being poorly supported by the infantry, he could not recapture
them. Two horse-artillery guns were abandoned soon afterwards.</p>

“About mid-day I received a letter from Newab Zemaun Khan

fanatics, and promising us supplies of provisions and firewood if we did
so. I communicated this to General Elphinstone, with the information
that the defile in front was strongly occupied. The General having
taken this into consideration, the utter confusion which prevailed, the
exhausted state of the Sepoys, who had been under arms in deep snow
from daylight of the 6th (with scarcely any rest, and neither food nor
water at the bivouac), joined with the pressure on the rear-guard, he
determined to halt till night and then pursue his march.”&mdash;[<i>Major

“I had just formed up a corps near Boot-Khak to resist a

him to continue the march, having only come three miles, and assured
him a halt on the snow, without tents or food, would destroy the troops;
but he was immoveable, talked of the Sirdars’ promises, and sending a
letter to Caubul to know why they had not sent us a safeguard. Here

The Jezailchees whom he commanded had been by this time nearly
annihilated, and “his services with them, therefore,” said Pottinger,
“could be of little further use.”</p>

“Down the centre,” says Eyre, “dashed a mountain torrent,
whose impetuous course the frost in vain attempted to arrest, though it
succeeded in lining the edges with thick layers of ice, over which the
snow lay consolidated in slippery masses, affording no very easy footing
for our jaded animals. This stream we had to cross and recross eight-and-twenty
times.”</p>

“On leaving Caubul,” says Captain Johnson, “each Sepoy had
40 rounds of ammunition in pouch, and about 60 camel loads per regiment,
with 100 spare loads. We have not at present (January 8), for
the whole force, three camel loads in box, and numbers of the Sepoys
have not a single cartridge in pouch.”</p>

Eyre says: “On the force reaching Koord-Caubul, snow began to
fall and continued till morning.”&mdash;[<i>Military Operations</i>, page 210.]
General Elphinstone says: “Ere we reached the bivouac snow fell and
continued during the night.” Brigadier Shelton says, on the other
hand, “On approaching Koord-Caubul it begun to snow, but fortunately
cleared up about dusk.” Such discrepancies as these may well
excuse the historian, if he be guilty of any slight errors of detail.</p>

The party consisted of Lady Macnaghten, Lady Sale, Mrs. Sturt
and one child; Mrs. Trevor and seven children; Captain Boyd, wife
and child; Captain Anderson, wife and child; Lieutenant Waller,
wife and child; Lieutenant Eyre, wife and child; Mr. Ryley, wife and
child; Mrs. Mainwaring and child; Serjeant Wade and family. Captain
Troup and Lieutenant Mein, being wounded and unserviceable,
went with them. Eyre says that it was the intention of the General
that all the wounded officers should go; but that there was not time
to make known his intentions.</p>

Eyre says “seventy files.” I give the above number on Shelton’s
authority&mdash;they were men of his own corps, and he was with them.</p>

<i>MS. Records.</i> Eyre says: “Brigadier Shelton commanded the
rear with a few Europeans; and but for his persevering energy and
unflinching fortitude in repelling the assailants, it is probable the whole
would have been sacrificed.”</p>

“As scarcely any Europeans of the advance now remained, and the
enemy were increasing, the General called several of the officers (about
twenty of us) to form line and show a front. We had scarcely done so,
when my friend Captain Grant, who was next to me, received a ball
through his cheek, which broke his jaw. I lifted him off his horse,
and seated him on the ground.”&mdash;[<i>Capt. Johnson’s Journal.</i>]</p>

“Subsequently,” says Captain Johnson, “we had the extreme
mortification to learn that not one particle of food or water had been
tasted by the troops from their arrival to their departure from Jugdulluck.”</p>

This was written in 1851, since which time Dum-Dum has ceased
to be the head-quarters’ station of the Artillery&mdash;but the column,
which was imperfectly constructed, has been blown down, and I believe
that only the base with the inscription remains.</p>

to have been extended, suggestively, by Pottinger, but disapproved by
Akbar Khan.</p>
